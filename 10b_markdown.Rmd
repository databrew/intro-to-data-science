# `Markdown` documentation 

#### Learning goals {-}

- How to document your projects with `Markdown`, and why doing so is so important.

&nbsp;  

This is a **meta-tutorial** for using `Markdown`, a "syntax" for writing
*beautiful* reports with simple text files. This tutorial, which was written
in `Markdown`, has been provided twice: first, as its formatted 'book-ready' 
form, and second as the raw text file used to write it.  

## What is `Markdown`?  {-}  

`Markdown` lets you write documents formatted with fancy `HTML` (the main
language used to create websites) without having to know how to write `HTML`
code. Instead, you just need to know how to use a few common symbols. 

### Why? {-} 
`Markdown` was created because most data scientists used to document their
code and data projects with simple text files (`.txt`). Text files are designed
to be simple, so they have no special formatting: no nice fonts, no headings,
no bold, no italics, no bullet lists. And, as a result of their simplicity,
text files are (1) *boring* and (2) *difficult to organize*.  

`Markdown` is the perfect solution: it translates a simple text file into a
beautifully formatted report.  

Recall that, in order for your research to be truly reproducible, you have to
**document your work thoroughly**. Doing so requires two things: First, that
you provide a detailed description of your work in a simple text file, and
second, that your documentation be *well-organized* and *enjoyably legible*.
Think about it: if your documentation is incomplete, impossible to navigate,
and difficult to read, can you really say that your project is reproducible?

### What can you do with `Markdown`? {-}  

First of all, `Markdown` ...  

1. Lets you organize your report into sections and subsections.  
2. Lets you *italicize* and **emphasize** certain sections of your work. 
3. Lets you distinguish between normal text and `code` or `filenames`. 
4. Lets you write large chunks of code, like the one below. 

```
# This is a large chunk of code. 
x <- 1:10
y <- 15:20
z <- x + y
```

Also, `Markdown` ...  

- Lets you weave together your documentation with `R` code that
*actually runs* (this is called `RMarkdown`, which is covered
in the next module), opening up possibilities for automatic reporting
and truly reproducible research publications.  

- Lets you produce publication-ready articles and books, since there is a
world of open-source formatting templates available to you.  

- Lets you add [hyperlinks](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).  

- Lets you type `HTML` code directly into the same document, 
<font color='red'><b>if you want to</b></font>. 

- Lets you include images, like the one below.

</center>

&nbsp;  

#### Common `Markdown` mistakes {-}

- When you try to make a section heading (e.g., `## New section`),
you forget to put a space between the hashtags and the name of the section.  

- When you try to begin a new paragraph, you don't add *two spaces*
at the end of your sentence. (Without those two spaces, `Markdown`
will assume you are still working in the same paragraph.) 

- The same thing happens often when making a list. Without *two spaces*
at the end of each item, the items might not get placed on new lines.  

- When you try to begin a new paragraph, you don't add an empty line
between your paragraphs.  

## Raw `Markdown` example {-}  

Below we provide the raw textfile we used to write the section above.

## Exercises {-}  

**Open a new, blank `Markdown` document:**  

**1.** In `RStudio`, go to the top left dropbown menu for making a new file (look for the green plus sign.)  

**2.** Select "Text File"   

**3.** Save this text file as `test.md`.  

The prefix, `.md`, specifies that this text file should be interpreted as a `Markdown` file. Once you save the file, you should see some new options appear, one of which is preview.  

**4.** At the top of your `test.md` file, write: `# Title`  

**5.** Click the Preview button and see if a `Markdown` file is produced.  

&nbsp;  

**Make your own `Markdown`:**  
Use the `Markdown` example above, which you can compare to the formatted version at the top of this module, to figure out how to add the following elements to your document. 

Use the *Preview* button to test if your entries are doing what you want them to.  

**6.** Write a silly sentence.  

**7.** Make a word in that sentence *italicized*. 

**8.** Make a word in that sentence **boldface.**  

**9.** Add the first section to your document. Name it whatever you want.  

**10.** Add a sentence in this new section, formatting one of its words as a piece of `code`.  

**11.** Start a new paragraph and add another sentence. 

**12.** Start a third paragraph and add vertical space between it and the previous paragraph.  

**13.** Add a multi-line chunk of code.  

**14.** Download a silly meme from the internet and add it to your document. (*Hint:* you will have to place that image file in the same folder as your `Markdown` file.)  

**15.** Add another subsection to the subsection you are working in. Name it "Grocery List".

**16.** Type out an enumerated grocery list.  

**17.** Add another subsection, this time at the same hierarchichal level as the one you created in step 9. Name it "Bucket List".  

**18.** Create a bullet list of things you want to accomplish before you die.  

**19.** Make one of your list items act as a link to another website.  

&nbsp;  

**Update your `Git` repo `README` with `Markdown`**  

This will be a review of both `Markdown` and `Git`!  

**20.** Navigate to your `GitHub` repo online.

**21.** If you have not yet added a `README` file to your repo, click on the button that generates one for you.  

**22.** Click on the file to edit it.  

**23.** Add `Markdown` to your `README`, showcasing the tricks you haved learned in this exercise thus far.  *Preview* your changes as you go and make sure everything looks how you intended.  

**24.** Commit your changes and check out your `README` on the homepage of your repo.  

&nbsp;  

**Make a `Markdown` CV**  

It is increasingly common for data scientists to have a Markdown version of their *CV* posted as its own page connected to their `GitHub` profile.  Check out these examples:

- [Here](https://carolstran.github.io/cv/)  
- [Also here](https://github.com/ViliamV/easy-markdown-cv)    
- [And here!](http://wodenimoni.com/nimo-markdown-cv/)  

Maintaining your *CV* this way can be very efficient. It is easy to format and easy to update. And, most importantly, rather than have various versions of your *CV* on your computer or in GoogleDrive, you can just share a *link* to your live, published *CV*. What better way to demonstrate your skillset in reproducible, professional-quality research?  


**25.** Use the instructions provided [here](https://workwithcarolyn.com/blog/digital-cv-guide) to create a new repo for your *CV*, type up your *CV* in `Markdown`, and publish it for free on `GitHub Pages`. 

This will also be a review of both `Markdown` and `Git`!
