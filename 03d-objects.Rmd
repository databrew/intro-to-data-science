## Variables in `R` {-}

So far we have strictly been using `R` as a calculator, with commands such as: 

```{r}
3 + 5
```

Of course, `R` can do much, much more than these basic computations. Your first step in uncovering the potential of `R` is learning how to use **variables**.

In `R`, a variable is a convenient way of referring to an underlying value. That value can be as simple as a single number (e.g., `6`), or as complex as a spreadsheet that is many Gigabytes in size. It may be useful to think of a variable as a cup; just as cups make it easy to hold your coffee and carry it from the kitchen to the couch, variables make it easy to contain and work with data.

### Declaring variables {-}

To assign numbers or other types of data to a variable, you use the `<` and `-` characters to make the arrow symbol `<-`.

```{r}
x <- 3+5
```

As the direction of the `<-` arrow suggests, this command stores the result of `3 + 5` into the variable `x`.

Unlike before, you did not see `8` printed to the *Console*. That is because the result was stored into `x`.


### Calling variables {-}

If you wanted R to tell you what "x" is, just type the variable name into the *Console* and run that command:

```{r}
x
```

Want to create a variable but also see its value at the same time? Here's a handy trick:

```{r}
x <- 3*12 ; x

```

The semicolon simulates hitting `Enter`. It says: first run `x <- 3*12`, then run `x`.

You can also update variables.

```{r}
x <- x * 3 ; x
x <- x * 3 ; x
```

You can also add variables together.

```{r}
x <- 8
y <- 4.5
x + y
```

### Naming variables  {-}

Variables are case-sensitive! If you misspell a variable name, you will confuse `R` and get an error.  

For example, ask `R` to tell you the value of capital `X`. The error message will be `Error: object 'X' not found`, which means `R` looked in its memory for an object (i.e., a variable) named `X` and could not find one.

You can make variable names as complicated or simple as you want.

```{r}
supercalifragilistic.expialidocious <- 5
supercalifragilistic.expialidocious  # still works
```

Note that periods and underscores can be used in variable names:

```{r}
my.variable <- 5 # periods can be used
my_variable <- 5 # underscores can be used
```

However, hyphens cannot be used since that symbol is used for subtraction.

Naming variables is a bit of an art. The trick is using names that are clear but are not so complicated that typing them is tedious or prone to errors.

Some names need to be avoided, since `R` uses them for special purposes. For example, `data` should be avoided, as should `mean`, since both are functions built-in to `R` and `R` is liable to interpret them as such instead of as a variable containing your data.

Note that `R` uses a feature called 'Tab complete' to help you type variable names. Begin typing a variable name, such as `supercalifragilistic.expialidocious` from the example above, but after the first few letters press the `Tab` key. `R` will then give you options for auto-completing your word. Press `Tab` again, or `Enter`, to accept the auto-complete. This is a handy way to avoid typos.


#### Exercise 1 {-}

A. Estimate how many bananas you've eaten in your lifetime and store that value in a variable (choose whatever name you wish).  

B. Now estimate how many ice cream sandwiches you've eaten in your lifetime and store that in a different variable.  

C. Now use these variables to calculate your Banana-to-ICS ratio. Store your result in a third variable, then call that variable in the Console to see your ratio.  

D. Who in the class has the highest ratio? Who has the lowest?  



## Types of data in `R` {-}

So far we have been working exclusively with numeric data. But  there are many different data types in R. We call these “types” of data **classes**:

* Decimal values like 4.5 are called **numeric** data.
* Natural numbers like 4 are called **integers**. Integers are also numerics.
* Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called **logical** data.
* Text (or string) values are called **character** data.

In order to be combined, data have to be the same class. 

R is able to compute the following commands ...

```{r}
x <- 6
y <- 4
x + y
```

... but not these:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- 6
y <- "4"
x + y
```

That's because the quotation marks used in naming `y` causes `R` to interpret `y` as a `character` class.

To see how `R` is interpreting variables, you can use the `class()` function:

```{r}
x <- 100
class(x)

x <- "100"
class(x)

x <- 100 == 101
class(x)
```

Another data type to be aware of is **factors**, but we will deal with them later.
