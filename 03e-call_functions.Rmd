## Introducing `R` functions {-}

You have already worked with many `R` functions; commands like `getwd()`, `length()`, and `unique()` are all functions. You know a command is a function because it has parentheses, `()`, attached at its end.

Just as **variables** are convenient names used for calling *objects* such as vectors or dataframes, **functions** are convenient names for calling *processes* or *actions*. An `R` function is just a batch of code that performs a certain action.  

Variables represent data, while functions represent code.  

Most functions have three key components: (1) one or more inputs, (2) a process that is applied to those inputs, and (3) an output of the result. When you call a function in `R`, you are saying, "Hey `R`, take this information, do something to it, and return the result to me." You supply the function with the inputs, and the function takes care of the rest.

Take the function `mean()`, for example. `mean()` finds the arithmetic mean (i.e., the average) of a set of values.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- c(4,6,3,2,6,8,5,3) # create a vector of numbers
mean(x) # find their mean
```

In this command, you are feeding the function `mean()` with the input `x`. 

### Base functions in `R` {-}

There are hundreds of functions already built-in to `R`. These functions are called *"base functions"*. Throughout these modules, we have been -- and will continue -- introducing you to the most commonly used base functions.

You can access other functions through bundles of external code known as *packages*, which we explain in an upcoming module. 

You can also write your *own* functions (and you will!). We provide an entire module on how to do this.

Note that not all functions require an input. The function `getwd()`, for example, does not need anything in its parentheses to find and return current your working directory.

### Saving function output  {-}

You will almost always want to save the result of a function in a new variable. Otherwise the function just prints its result to the *Console* and `R` forgets about it.  

You can store a function result the same way you store any value:  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- c(4,6,3,2,6,8,5,3) 
x_mean <- mean(x) 
x_mean
```

### Functions with multiple inputs {-}

Note that `mean()` accepts a second input that is called `na.rm`. This is short for `NA.remove`. When this is set to `TRUE`, `R` will remove broken or missing values from the vector before calculating the mean.

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
x <- c(4,6,3,2,NA,8,5,3)  # note the NA
mean(x,na.rm=TRUE)
```

If you tried to run these commands with `na.rm` set to `FALSE`, `R` would throw an error and give up.  

Note that you provided the function `mean()` with two inputs, `x` and `na.rm`, and that you separated each input with a comma. This is how you pass multiple inputs to a function.  

### Function defaults {-}

Note that many functions have default values for their inputs. If you do not specify the input's value yourself, `R` will assume you just want to use the default. In the case of `mean()`, the default value for `na.rm` is `FALSE`. This means that the following code would throw an error ...

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
x <- c(4,6,3,2,NA,8,5,3)  # note the NA
mean(x)
```

Because `R` will assume you are using the default value for `na.rm`, which is `FALSE`, which means you do not want to remove missing values before trying to calculate the mean.


### Function documentation (i.e., getting help) {-}

Functions are designed to accept only a certain number of inputs with only certain names. To figure out what a function expects in terms of inputs, and what you can expect in terms of output, you can call up the function's help page:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
?mean
```

When you enter this command, the help documentation for `mean()` will appear in the bottom right pane of your `RStudio` window: 

![](img/functions_help.png)

Learning how to read this documentation is essential to becoming competent in using `R`.  

**Be warned:** not all documentation is easy to understand! You will come to really resent poorly written documentation and really appreciate well-written documentation; the few extra minutes taken by the function's author to write good documentation saves users around the world hours of frustration and confusion.

*  The `Title` and `Description` help you understand what this function does.  

* The `Usage` section shows you how type out the function.

* The `Arguments` section lists out each possible argument (which in `R` lingo is another word for *input* or *parameter*), explains what that input is asking for, and details any formatting requirements. 

* The `Value` section describes what the function returns as output. 

* At the bottom of the help page, example code is provided to show you how the function works. You can copy and paste this code into your own script of *Console* and check out the results.

Note that more complex functions may also include a `Details` section in their documentation, which gives more explanation about what the function does, what kinds of inputs it requires, and what it returns.  


### Function examples  {-}

`R` comes with a set of base functions for descriptive statistics, which provide good examples of how functions work and why they are valuable. 

We can use the same vector as the input for all of these functions:  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- c(4,6,3,2,NA,8,9,5,6,1,9,2,6,3,0,3,2,5,3,3)  # note the NA
```

**`mean()`** has been explained above.  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
result <- mean(x,na.rm=TRUE)
result
```

**`median()`** returns the median value in the supplied vector:  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
result <- median(x,na.rm=TRUE)
result
```

**`sd()`** returns the standard deviation of the supplied vector:  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
result <- sd(x,na.rm=TRUE)
result
```

**`summary()`** returns a vector that describes several aspects of the vector's distribution:  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
result <- summary(x,na.rm=TRUE)
result
```
