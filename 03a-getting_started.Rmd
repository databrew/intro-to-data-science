**Fourth, make sure `R` is running correctly in the background:**    

In `RStudio`, in the pane on the left (the "Console”), type 2+2 and hit Enter.  
If `R` is working properly, the number “4” will be printed in the next line down.

**Finally, some minor adjustments to make `RStudio` run smoother (and look cooler):**

Go to `Tools > Global Options` and make sure your `General` settings match these:
