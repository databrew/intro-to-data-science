# Setting up `RStudio`

First, let's get the right programs installed on your computer. Then we will explain what they are and why you need them.   


**First, download and install `R`: **   

Go to the following website, click the *Download* button, and follow the website's instructions from there.

**Second, download and install `RStudio`:**    

Go to the following website and choose the free Desktop version:

&nbsp;

**Third, make sure `RStudio` opens successfully:**    

Open the `RStudio` app. A window should appear that looks like this:

&nbsp;

**Fourth, make sure `R` is running correctly in the background:**    

In `RStudio`, in the pane on the left (the "Console”), type 2+2 and hit Enter.  
If `R` is working properly, the number “4” will be printed in the next line down.

&nbsp;

**Finally, some minor adjustments to make `RStudio` run smoother (and look cooler):**

Go to `Tools > Global Options` and make sure your `General` settings match these exactly:

Specifically, **uncheck** the option under *Workspace* to 'Restore .RData into workspace at startup.'  

Now go to the `Appearance` settings and choose a cool theme!

**Boom!**

```{r, results = 'asis', eval = ifelse(exists('is_teacher'),is_teacher,TRUE),echo=FALSE}
source('teacher_tip.R')

tip <- 'These installations can be clunky with a large class, and it is never fun to start out with a bunch of technical hang-ups. We recommend assigning this work **prior** to the start of the first class. Hold office hours the hour before class in order to troubleshoot one-on-one with students if they need help.'
