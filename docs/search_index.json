Then we will explain what they are and why you need them. First, download and install R: Go to the following website, click the Download button, and follow the website’s instructions from there. https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/   Second, download and install RStudio: Go to the following website and choose the free Desktop version: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/   Third, make sure RStudio opens successfully: Open the RStudio app. A window should appear that looks like this:   Fourth, make sure R is running correctly in the background: In RStudio, in the pane on the left (the “Console”), type 2+2 and hit Enter. If R is working properly, the number “4” will be printed in the next line down.   Fifth, install supplementary software: In order to install certain packages, you’ll need to take one more step: On Windows, download http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and run the installer On Mac, you need Xcode Command Line Tools. You might already have this. Check by running devtools::has_devel(). If You don’t have it, open shell/terminal and run xcode-select --install Alternatively, no Mac, you can download Xcode from the Mac App Store correctly: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12 Finally, some minor adjustments to make RStudio run smoother (and look cooler): Go to Tools &gt; Global Options and make sure your General settings match these exactly: Specifically, uncheck the option under Workspace to ‘Restore .RData into workspace at startup.’ Now go to the Appearance settings and choose a cool theme! Boom!   Instructor tip: These installations can be clunky with a large class, and it is never fun to start out with a bunch of technical hang-ups. We recommend assigning this work prior to the start of the first class. Hold office hours the hour before class in order to troubleshoot one-on-one with students if they need help.   "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
