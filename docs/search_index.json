You will get a tour of RStudio in the next module. For now, look at the left half of the screen. You should see a large pane entitled the Console. NOTE: Insert screenshot here RStudio’s Console is your window into R, the engine under the hood. The Console is where you type commands for R to run, and where R prints back the results of what you have told it to do. Running code in the Console Type your first command into the Console, then press Enter: 1 + 1 [1] 2 When you press Enter, R processes the command you fed it, then returns its result (2) just below your command. Note that spaces don’t matter. Both of the following two commands are legible to R and return the same thing: 4 + 4 [1] 8 4+4 [1] 8 However, it is better to make your code as easy to read as possible, which usually means using spaces. Exercise 1 Type a command in the Console to determine the sum of 596 and 198. Re-running code in the Console If you want to re-run the code you just ran, or if you want to recall the code so that you can adjust it slightly, click anywhere in the Console then press your keyboard’s Up arrow. If you keep pressing your Up arrow, R will present you with sequentially older commands. If you accidentally recalled an old command without meaning to, you can reset the Console’s command line by pressing Escape. Exercise 2 A. Re-run the sum of 596 and 198 without re-typing it. B. Recall the command again, but this time adjust the code to find the sum of 596 and 298. C. Practice escaping an accidentally called command: recall your most recent command, then clear the Console’s command line. Incomplete commands in R R gets confused when you enter an incomplete command, and will wait for you to write the remainder of your command on the next line in the Console before doing anything. For example, try running this code in your Console: 45 + You will find that R gives you a little + sign on the line under your command, which means it is waiting for you to complete your command. If you want to complete your command, add a number (e.g., 3) and hit Enter. You should now be given an answer (e.g., 48). If instead you want R to stop waiting and stop running, hit the Escape key. Getting errors in R R only understands your commands if they follow the rules of the R language (often referred to as its syntax). If R does not understand your code, it will throw an error and give up on trying to execute that line of code. For example, try running this code in your Console: 4 + 6p You probably received a message in red font stating Error: unexpected symbol in \"4 + 6p\". That is because R did know how to interpret the symbol p in this case. Get used to errors! They happen all the time, even (especially?) to professionals, and it is essential that you get used to reading your own code to find and fix its errors. Exercise 3 Type a command in R that throws an error, then recall the command and revise so that R can understand it. Use R like a calculator As you can tell from those commands you just ran, R is, at heart, a fancy calculator. Some calculations are straightforward, like addition and subtraction: 490 + 1000 [1] 1490 490 - 1000 [1] -510 Division is pretty straightfoward too: 24 / 2 [1] 12 For multiplication, use an asterisk (*): 24 * 2 [1] 48 R is usually great about following classic rules for Order of Operations, and you can use parentheses to exert control over that order. For example, these two commands produce different results: 2*7 - 2*5 / 2 [1] 9 (2*7 - 2*5) / 2 [1] 2 You denote exponents like this: 2 ^2 [1] 4 2 ^3 [1] 8 2 ^4 [1] 16 Finally, note that R is fine with negative numbers: 9 + -100 [1] -91 Exercise 4 A. Find the sum of the ages of everyone in your immediate family. B. Now recall that command and adjust it to determine the average age of the members of your family. 7.1 Using operators in R You can get R to evaluate logical tests using operators. For example, you can ask whether two values are equal to each other. 96 == 95 [1] FALSE 95 + 2 == 95 + 2 [1] TRUE R is telling you that the first statement is FALSE (96 is not, in fact, equal to 95) and that the second statement is TRUE (95 + 2 is, in fact, equal to itself). Note the use of double equal signs here. You must use two of them in order for R to understand that you are asking for this logical test. You can also ask if two values are NOT equal to each other: 96 != 95 [1] TRUE 95 + 2 != 95 + 2 [1] FALSE This test is a bit more difficult to understand: In the first statement, R is telling you that it is TRUE that 96 is different from 95. In the second statement, R is saying that it is FALSE that 95 + 2 is not the same as itself. Note that R lets you write these tests another, even more confusing way: ! 96 == 95 [1] TRUE ! 95 + 2 == 95 + 2 [1] FALSE The first line of code is asking R whether it is not true that 96 and 95 are equal to each other, which is TRUE. The second line of code is asking R whether it is not true that 95 + 2 is the same as itself, which is of course FALSE. Other commonly used operators in R include greater than / less than (&gt; and &lt;), and greater/less than or equal to (&gt;= and &lt;=). 100 &gt; 100 [1] FALSE 100 &gt;= 100 [1] TRUE Exercise 5 A. Write and run a line of code that asks whether these two calculations return the same result: 2*7 - 2*5 / 2 (2*7 - 2*5) / 2 B. Now write and run a line of code that asks whether the first calculation is larger than the second: 7.2 Use built-in functions within R R has some built-in functions for common calculations, such as finding square roots and logarithms. sqrt(16) [1] 4 log(4) [1] 1.386294 Note that the function log() is the natural log function (i.e., the value that e must be raised to in order to equal 4). To calculate a base-10 logarithm, use log10( ). log(10) [1] 2.302585 log10(10) [1] 1 Another handy function is round(), for rounding numbers to a specific number of decimal places. 100/3 [1] 33.33333 round(100/3) [1] 33 round(100/3,digits=1) [1] 33.3 round(100/3,digits=2) [1] 33.33 round(100/3,digits=3) [1] 33.333 Finally, R also comes with some built-in values, such as pi: pi [1] 3.141593 Exercise 6 Find the square root of pi and round the answer to the 2 decimal places.

Understand what a working directory is, and how to use it. Learn basic project work flow R and RStudio: what’s the difference? These two entities are similar, but it is important to understand how they are different. In short, R is a open-source (i.e., free) coding language: a powerful programming engine that can be used to do really cool things with data. R Studio, in contrast, is a free user interface that helps you interact with R. If you think of R as an engine, then it helps to think of RStudio as the car that contains it. Like a car,RStudio makes it easier and more comfortable to use the engine to get where you want to go. R Studio needs R in order to function, but R can technically be used on its own outside of RStudio if you want. However, just as a good car mechanic can get an engine to run without being installed within a car, using R on its own is a bit clunky and requires some expertise. For beginners (and everyone else, really), R is just so much more pleasant to use when you are operating it from within RStudio. RStudio also has increasingly powerful extensions that make R even more useful and versatile in data science. These extensions allow you to use R to make interactive data dashboards, beautiful and reproducible data reports, presentations, websites, and even books. And new features like these are regularly being added to RStudio by its all-star team of data scientists. That is why this book always uses RStudio when working with R. Two-minute tour of RStudio When you open RStudio for the first time, you will see a window that looks like the screenshot below. Console You are already acquainted with RStudio’s Console, the window pane on the left that you use to “talk” to R. (See the previous module.) Environment In the top right pane, the Environment, RStudio will maintain a list of all the datasets, variables, and functions that you are using as you work. The next modules will explain what variables and functions are. This is the pane that is used the least often, and if you wish it can simplify your workspace to minimize it. Files, Plots, Packages, &amp; Help You will use the bottom right pane very often. The Files tab lets you see all the files within your working directory, which will be explained in the section below. The Plots tab lets you see the plots you are producing with your code. The Packages tab lets you see the packages you currently have installed on your computer. Packages are bundles of R functions downloaded from the internet; they will be explained in detail a few modules down the road. The Help tab is very important! It lets you see documentation (i.e., user’s guides) for the functions you use in your code. Functions will also be explained in detail a few modules down the road. These three panes are useful, but the most useful window pane of all is actually missing when you first open RStudio. This important pane is where you work with scripts. Scripts Before explaining what scripts are and why they are awesome, let’s start a new script. To start a new script, go to the top left icon in the RStudio window, and click on the green plus sign with a blank page behind it: A dropdown window will appear. Select “R Script”. A new window pane will then appear in the top left quadrant of your RStudio window: You now have a blank script to work in! Now type some simple commands into your script: x &lt;- 2 x Notice that when you press Enter after each line of code, nothing happens in the Console. In order to send this code to the Console, press Enter + Command at the same time (or Enter + Control, if you are on Windows) for each line of code. To send both lines of code to the Console at once, select both lines of code and hit Enter + Command. (To select multiple lines of code, you can (1) click and drag with your mouse or (2) hold down your Shift key while clicking your down arrow key. To select all lines of code, press Command + A.) Exercise 1 Add a few more lines to your script, such that your script now looks like this. x &lt;- 2 x y &lt;- x*56 z &lt;- y / 23 x + y + z Run all of these lines of code at once. Now change the value of x and re-run all of the code. Think about how much more efficient part (B) was thanks to your script! If you had typed all of that directly into your Console, you would have to recall or retype each line individually. Now think about how much of a different your script would make if the number of commands was 500, instead of five! What is an R script, and why are scripts so awesome? An R script is a file where you can keep a record of your code. Just as a script tells actors exactly what to say and when to say it, an R script tells R exactly what code to run, and in what order to run it. When working with R, you will almost always type your code into a script first, then send it to the Console. You can run your code immediately using Enter + Command, but you also have a script of what you have done so that you can run the exact same code at a later time To understand why R scripts are so awesome, consider a typical workflow in Excel of GoogleSheets. You open a big complicated spreadsheet, spend hours making changes, and save your changes frequently throughout your work session. The main disadvantages of this workflow are that: There is no detailed record of the changes you have made. You cannot prove that you have made changes correctl. You cannot pass the original dataset to someone else and ask them to revise it in the same way you have. (Nor would you want to, since making all those changes was so time-consuming!) Nor could your take a different dataset and guarantee that you are able to apply the exact same changes that you applied to the first. In other words, your work is not reproducible. Making those changes is labor-intensive! Rather than spend time manually making changes to a single spreadsheet, it would be better to devote that energy to writing R code that makes those changes for you. That code could be run in this one case, but it could also be run at any later time, or easily modified to make similar changes to other spreadsheets. You are modifying your original dataset, which is always dangerous and a big No-No in data science. Each time you save your work in Excel or GoogleSheets (which automatically saves each change you make), the original spreadsheet file gets replaced by the updated version. But if you brought your dataset into R instead, and modified it using an R script, then you leave the raw data alone and keep it safe. (Sure, you can always save different versions of your Excel file, but then you run the risk of mixing up versions and getting confused.) Working with R scripts allows you to avoid all of these pitfalls. When you write an R script, you are making your work …. Efficient. Once you get comfortable writing R code, you will be able to write scripts in a few minutes. Those scripts can modify datasets within seconds (or less) in ways that would take hours (or years) to carry out manually in Excel or GoogleSheets. Reproducible. Once you have written anR script, you can reproduce your own work whenever you want to. You can send your script to a colleague so that they can reproduct your work as well. Reproducible wrk is defensible work. Low-risk. Since your R script does not make any changes to the original data, you are keeping your data safe. It is essential top preserve the sancitty of raw data! Note that there is nothing fancy or special about an R script. An R script is a simple text file; that is, it only accepts basic text; you can’t add images or change font style or font size in an R script; just letters, numbers, and your other keyboard keys. The file’s extension, .R tells your computer to interpret that text as R code. Commenting your code Another advantage of scripts is that you can include comments throughout your code to explain what you are doing and why. A comment is just a part of your script that is useful to you but that is ignored by R. To add comments to your code, use the hashtag symbol (#). Any text following a # will be ignored by R. Here is the script above, now with comments added: # Define variable x x &lt;- 2 x # Make a new variable, y, based on x y &lt;- x*56 z &lt;- y / 23 # Make a third variable, z, based on y x + y + z # Now get the sum of all three variables Adding comments can be more work, but in the end it saves you time and makes your code more effective. Comments might not seem necessary in the moment, but it is amazing how helpful they are when you come back to your code the next day. Frequent and helpful comments make the difference between good and great code. Comment early, comment often! You can also use lines hashtags to visually organize your code. For example: ############################################## # Setup ############################################## # Define variable x x &lt;- 2 x # Make a new variable, y, based on x y &lt;- x*56 z &lt;- y / 23 # Make a third variable, z, based on y ############################################## # Get result ############################################## x + y + z # Now get the sum of all three variables This might not seem necessary with a 5-line script, but adding visual breaks to your code becomes immensely helpful when your code grows to be hundreds of lines long. Saving your work R scripts are only useful if you save them! Unlike working with GoogleDocs or GoogleSheets, R will not automatically save your changes; you have to do that yourself. (This is inconvenient, but it is also safer; most of coding is trial and error, and sometimes you want to be careful about what is saved.) Where to save your work? The folder in which you save your R script will be referred to as your working directory (see the next section). For the sake of these tutorials, it will be most convenient to save all of your scripts in a single folder that is in an easily accessed location. We suggest making a nw folder on your Desktop and naming it databoom, but you can name it whatever you want and place it wherever you want. How to save your script? To save the script you have opened and typed a few lines of code into, press Command + S (or Control + S). Alternatively, go to File &gt; Save. Navigate to the folder you just created and type in a file name that is simple but descriptive. We suggest making a new R script for each module, and naming those scripts according to each module’s name. In this case, we recommend naming your script intro_to_rstudio. (It is good practice to avoid spaces in your file names; it will be essential later on, so good to begin the correct habit now. Start using an underscore (_) instead of a space.) Your working directory When you work with data in R, R will need to know where in your computer to look for that data. The folder it looks in is known as your working directory. To find out which folder R is currently using as your working directory, use the function getwd(): getwd() [1] &quot;/Users/erickeen/repos/intro-to-data-science&quot; Almost always, you want to set your working directory to the folder your R script is in. How to set your working directory Whenever you begin a new R script, setting your working directory will be one of the first things you do. There are three ways to set your working directory: Manually without code. On the top banner in RStudio, go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File Location: This action sets your working directory to the same folder that your R script is in. When you do this, you will see that a command has been entered into your Console: (Note that the filepath may be different on your machine.) This code is using the function setwd(), which is also used in the next option. Manually with code, using setwd(): You can manually provide the filepath you want to set as your working directory. This option allows you to set your wd to whatever folder you want. The character string within the setwd() command is the path to a folder. The formatting of this string must be exact, otherwise R will throw an error. Use option 1 at first to get a sense of how your computer formats its folder paths. Copy, paste, and modify the output from option 1 in order to type your path correctly. Automatically with code: There is a command you can run that automatically sets your working directory to the folder that your R script is in. This is the most efficient and useful method, in our experience. To use this command, you must first install a new package. Run this code: install.packages(&quot;rstudioapi&quot;) library(rstudioapi) For now, you do not need to understand what this code is doing. We will explain packages and the library() function in a later module. You can now copy, paste, and run this code to set your working directory automatically: setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) This is a complicated line of code that you need not understand. As long as it works, it works! Confirm that R is using the correct working directory with the command getwd(). Typical workflows Now that you know how to create a script and set your working directory, you are prepared to work on data projects in RStudio. The workflow for beginning a new data project typically goes like this: In your file explorer… Create a folder for your project somewhere on your computer. This will become your working directory. Create subfolders within your working directory, if you want. We recommend creating a data subfolder, for keeping data, and a z subfolder, for keeping miscellaneous documents. The goal is to keep your working directory visually simple and organized; ideally, the only files not within subfolders are your R scripts. Add data to your working directory, if you have any. In RStudio … Create a new R script. Save it inside your intended working directory. At the top of your script, use comments to add a title, author info, and brief description. Add the code to set your working directory. Begin coding! Template R script Here is a template you can use to copy and paste into each new script you create: ################################################################################ # &lt; Add title here &gt; ################################################################################ # # &lt; Add brief description here &gt; # # &lt; Author &gt; # Created on &lt;add date here &gt; # ################################################################################ # Set working directory setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) ################################################################################ ################################################################################ # Code goes here ################################################################################ # (end of file) Review assignment: NOTE: Under construction!

"],["variables-in-r.html", "Module 9 Variables in R Learning goals Introducing variables Types of data in R Review assignment Other Resources", " Module 9 Variables in R Learning goals How to define variables and work with them in R Learn the various possible classes of data in R Introducing variables So far we have strictly been using R as a calculator, with commands such as: 3 + 5 [1] 8 Of course, R can do much, much more than these basic computations. Your first step in uncovering the potential of R is learning how to use variables. In R, a variable is a convenient way of referring to an underlying value. That value can be as simple as a single number (e.g., 6), or as complex as a spreadsheet that is many Gigabytes in size. It may be useful to think of a variable as a cup; just as cups make it easy to hold your coffee and carry it from the kitchen to the couch, variables make it easy to contain and work with data. Declaring variables To assign numbers or other types of data to a variable, you use the &lt; and - characters to make the arrow symbol &lt;-. x &lt;- 3+5 As the direction of the &lt;- arrow suggests, this command stores the result of 3 + 5 into the variable x. Unlike before, you did not see 8 printed to the Console. That is because the result was stored into x. Calling variables If you wanted R to tell you what x is, just type the variable name into the Console and run that command: x [1] 8 Want to create a variable but also see its value at the same time? Here’s a handy trick: x &lt;- 3*12 ; x [1] 36 The semicolon simulates hitting Enter. It says: first run x &lt;- 3*12, then run x. You can also update variables. x &lt;- x * 3 ; x [1] 108 x &lt;- x * 3 ; x [1] 324 You can also add variables together. x &lt;- 8 y &lt;- 4.5 x + y [1] 12.5 Naming variables Variables are case-sensitive! If you misspell a variable name, you will confuse R and get an error. For example, ask R to tell you the value of capital X. The error message will be Error: object 'X' not found, which means R looked in its memory for an object (i.e., a variable) named X and could not find one. You can make variable names as complicated or simple as you want. supercalifragilistic.expialidocious &lt;- 5 supercalifragilistic.expialidocious # still works [1] 5 Note that periods and underscores can be used in variable names: my.variable &lt;- 5 # periods can be used my_variable &lt;- 5 # underscores can be used However, hyphens cannot be used since that symbol is used for subtraction. Also note that variables are case-sensitive! If you name a variable My_variable, R will not recognize it if you refer to it as My_Variable. Naming theory Naming variables is a bit of an art. The trick is using names that are clear but are not so complicated that typing them is tedious or prone to errors. Some names need to be avoided, since R uses them for special purposes. For example, data should be avoided, as should mean, since both are functions built-in to R and R is liable to interpret them as such instead of as a variable containing your data. Note that R uses a feature called ‘Tab complete’ to help you type variable names. Begin typing a variable name, such as supercalifragilistic.expialidocious from the example above, but after the first few letters press the Tab key. R will then give you options for auto-completing your word. Press Tab again, or Enter, to accept the auto-complete. This is a handy way to avoid typos. Exercise 1 A. Estimate how many bananas you’ve eaten in your lifetime and store that value in a variable (choose whatever name you wish). B. Now estimate how many ice cream sandwiches you’ve eaten in your lifetime and store that in a different variable. C. Now use these variables to calculate your Banana-to-ICS ratio. Store your result in a third variable, then call that variable in the Console to see your ratio. D. Who in the class has the highest ratio? Who has the lowest? Types of data in R So far we have been working exclusively with numeric data. But there are many different data types in R. We call these “types” of data classes: Decimal values like 4.5 are called numeric data. Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics. Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical data. Text (or string) values are called character data. In order to be combined, data have to be the same class. R is able to compute the following commands … x &lt;- 6 y &lt;- 4 x + y [1] 10 … but not these: x &lt;- 6 y &lt;- &quot;4&quot; x + y That’s because the quotation marks used in naming y causes R to interpret y as a character class. To see how R is interpreting variables, you can use the class() function: x &lt;- 100 class(x) [1] &quot;numeric&quot; x &lt;- &quot;100&quot; class(x) [1] &quot;character&quot; x &lt;- 100 == 101 class(x) [1] &quot;logical&quot; Another data type to be aware of is factors, but we will deal with them later.

Introducing data structures Data belong to different classes, as explained in the previous module, and they can be arranged into various structures. So far we have been dealing only with variables that contain a single value, but the real value of R comes from assigning entire sets of data to a variable. Vectors The simplest data structure in R is a vector. A vector is simply a set of values. A vector can contain only a single value, as we have been working with thus far, or it can contain many millions of values. Declaring and using vectors To build up a vector in R, use the function c(), which is short for “concatenate”. x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) x [1] 5 6 7 8 You can use the c() function to concatenate two vectors together: x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) y &lt;- c(9,10,11,12) z &lt;- c(x,y) z [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 You can also use c() to add values to a vector: x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) x &lt;- c(x,9) x [1] 5 6 7 8 9 When two vectors are of the same length, you can do arithmetic with them: x &lt;- c(5,6,7,8) y &lt;- c(9,10,11,12) x + y [1] 14 16 18 20 x - y [1] -4 -4 -4 -4 x * y [1] 45 60 77 96 x / y [1] 0.5555556 0.6000000 0.6363636 0.6666667 You can also put vectors through logical tests: x &lt;- 1:5 4 == x [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE This command is asking R to tell you whether each element in x is equal to 4. You can create vectors of any data class (i.e., data type). x &lt;- c(&quot;Ben&quot;,&quot;Joe&quot;,&quot;Eric&quot;) x [1] &quot;Ben&quot; &quot;Joe&quot; &quot;Eric&quot; y &lt;- c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE) y [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE Note that all values within a vector must be of the same class. You can’t combine numerics and characters into the same vector. If you did, R would try to convert the numbers to characters. For example: x &lt;- 4 y &lt;- &quot;6&quot; z &lt;- c(x,y) z [1] &quot;4&quot; &quot;6&quot; Useful functions for handling vectors length() tells you the number of elements in a vector: x &lt;- c(5,6) y &lt;- c(9,10,11,12) length(x) [1] 2 length(y) [1] 4 The colon symbol : creates a vector with every integer occurring between a min and max: x &lt;- 1:10 x [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 seq() allows you to build a vector using evenly spaced sequence of values between a min and max: seq(0,100,length=11) [1] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 In this command, you are telling R to give you a sequence of values from 0 to 100, and you want the length of that vector to be 11. R then figures out the spacing required between each value in order to make that happen. Alternatively, you can prescribe the interval between values instead of the length: seq(0,100,by=7) [1] 0 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84 91 98 rep() allows you to repeat a single value a specified number of times: rep(&quot;Hey!&quot;,times=5) [1] &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Hey!&quot; head() and tail() can be used to retrieve the first 6 or last 6 elements in a vector, respectively. x &lt;- 1:1000 head(x) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 tail(x) [1] 995 996 997 998 999 1000 You can also adjust how many elements to return: head(x,2) [1] 1 2 tail(x,10) [1] 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 1000 sort() allows you to order a vector from its smallest value to its largest: x &lt;- c(4,8,1,6,9,2,7,5,3) sort(x) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 rev() lets you reverse the order of elements within a vector: x &lt;- c(4,8,1,6,9,2,7,5,3) rev(x) [1] 3 5 7 2 9 6 1 8 4 rev(sort(x)) [1] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 which() allows you to ask, “For which elements of a vector is the following statement true?” x &lt;- 1:10 which(x==4) [1] 4 If no values within the vector meet the condition, a vector of length zero will be returned: x &lt;- 1:10 which(x == 11) integer(0) %in% is a handy operator that allows you to ask whether a value occurs within a vector: x &lt;- 1:10 4 %in% x [1] TRUE 11 %in% x [1] FALSE Exercise 2 NOTE: UNDER CONSTRUCTION! Subsetting vectors Since you will eventually be working with vectors that contain thousands of data points, it will be useful to have some tools for subsetting them – that is, looking at only a few select elements at a time. You can subset a vector using square brackets [ ]. x &lt;- 50:100 x[10] [1] 59 This command is asking R to return the 10th element in the vector x. x[10:20] [1] 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 This command is asking R to return elements 10:20 in the vector x. Exercise 3 A. Figure out how to replicate the head() function using your new vector subsetting skills. B. Now replicate the tail() function, using those same skills as well as the length() function you just learned. Dataframes &amp; other data structures A vector is the most basic data structure in R, and the other structures are built out of vectors. As a data scientist, the most common data structure you will be working with is a dataframe, which is essentially a spreadsheet: a dataset with rows and columns, in which each column represents is a vector of the same class of data. We will explore dataframes in detail later, but here is a sneak peak at what they look like: df &lt;- data.frame(x=300:310, y=600:610) df x y 1 300 600 2 301 601 3 302 602 4 303 603 5 304 604 6 305 605 7 306 606 8 307 607 9 308 608 10 309 609 11 310 610 In this command, we used the data.frame() function to combine two vectors into a dataframe with two columns named x and y. R then saved this result in a new variable named df. When we call df, R shows us the dataframe. The great thing about dataframes is that they allow you to relate different data types to each other. df &lt;- data.frame(name=c(&quot;Ben&quot;,&quot;Joe&quot;,&quot;Eric&quot;), height.inches=c(75,73,80)) df name height.inches 1 Ben 75 2 Joe 73 3 Eric 80 This dataframe has one column of class character and another of class numeric. The two other most common data structures are matrices and lists, but we will wait on learning about thos. For now, focus on becoming comfortable using vectors and dataframes.

Africa Rep.&quot;,&quot;China&quot;,&quot;Norway&quot;,&quot;India&quot;) lifespan &lt;- c(79,65,84,53,77,82,69) gdp &lt;- c(55335,2875,38674,623,13102,84500,6807) These data come from this publicly available database that compares health and economic indices across countries in 2011. The lifespan column presents the average life expectancy for each country. The gdp column presents the average GDP per capita within that country, which is a common index for the income and wealth of average citizens. Let’s see if there is a relationship between life expectancy and income. Create a basic plot The simplest way to make a basic plot in R is to use its built-in plot() function: plot(lifespan ~ gdp) This syntax is saying this: plot column lifespan as a function of gdp. The symbol ~ denotes “as a function of”. This frames lifespan as a dependent variable (y axis) that is affected by the independent variable (x axis), which in this case is gdp. Note that R uses the variable names you provided as the x- and y-axes. You can adjust these labels however you wish (see formatting section below). You can also produce this exact same plot using the following syntax: plot(y=lifespan, x=gdp) Choose whichever one is most intuitive to you. Most common types of plots The plot above is a scatter plot, and is one of the most common types of plots in data science. You can turn this into a line plot by adding a parameter to the plot() function: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, type=&quot;l&quot;) What a mess! Rather than connecting these values in the order you might expect, R connects them in the order that they are listed in their source vectors. This is why line plots tend to be more useful in scenarios such as time series, which are inherently ordered. Another common plot is the bar plot, which uses a different R function: barplot(height=lifespan,names.arg=country) In this command, the parameter height determines the height of the bars, and names.arg provides the labels to place beneath each bar. Note that one of the bar labels did not plot, because R did not have enough space to print the labels in a pretty way. Rather than create overlapping text, R is programmed to leave some labels out. You will be able to adjust text size on your own (see next section). There are many more plot types out there, but let’s stop here now. Exercise 1 Produce a bar plot that shows the GDP for each country. Basic plot formatting You can adjust the default formatting of plots by adding other inputs to your plot() command. To understand all the parameters you can adjust, bring up the help page for this function: ?plot If multiple help page options are returned, select the Generiz X-Y Plotting page from the base package. This is the plot function that comes built-in to R. Here we demonstrate just a few of the most common formatting adjustments you are likely to use: Set plot range using xlim (for the x axis) and ylim (for the y axis): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,xlim=c(0,60000),ylim=c(40,100)) In this command, you are defining axis limits using a 2-element vector (i.e., c(min,max)). Note that it can be easier to read your code if you put each input on a new line, like this: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, xlim=c(0,60000), ylim=c(40,100)) Make sure each input line within the function ends with a comma, otherwise you R will get confused and throw an error. Set dot type using the input pch: plot(lifespan ~ gdp,pch=16) Set dot color using the input col (the default is col=\"black\") plot(lifespan ~ gdp,col=&quot;red&quot;) Here is a great resource for color names in R. Set dot size using the input cex (the default is cex=1): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,cex=3) Set axis labels using the inputs xlab and ylab: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, xlab=&quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) Set axis number size using the input cex.axis (the default is cex.axis=1): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,cex.axis=.5) Set axis label size using the input cex.label (the default is cex.lab=1): plot(lifespan ~ gdp,cex.lab=.5) Set plot margins using the function par(mar=c()) before you call plot(): par(mar=c(5,5,0.5,0.5)) plot(lifespan ~ gdp) In this command, the four numbers in the vector used to define mar correspond to the margin for the bottom, left, top, and right sides of the plot, respectively. Create a multi-pane plot using the function par(mfrow=c()) before you call plot(): par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,col=&quot;red&quot;,pch=16) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,col=&quot;blue&quot;,pch=16) In this command, the two numbers in the vector used to define mfrow correspond to the number of rows and columns, respectively, on the entire plot. In this case, you have 1 row of plots with two columns. Note that you will need to reset the number of panes when you are done with your multi-pane plot! par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Plot dots and lines at once using the input type: par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,type=&quot;b&quot;) plot(lifespan ~ gdp,type=&quot;o&quot;) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Note the two slightly different formats here. Use a logarithmic scale for one or of your axes using the input log plot(lifespan ~ gdp,log=&quot;x&quot;) Exercise 2 Produce a beautifully formatted plot that incorporates all of these customization inputs explained above into a multi-paned plot. Plotting with data frames So far in this tutorial we have been using vectors to produce plots. This is nice for learning, but does not represent the real world very well. You will almost always be producing plots using dataframes. Let’s turn these vectors into a dataframe: df &lt;- data.frame(country,lifespan,gdp) df country lifespan gdp 1 USA 79 55335 2 Tanzania 65 2875 3 Japan 84 38674 4 Ctr. Africa Rep. 53 623 5 China 77 13102 6 Norway 82 84500 7 India 69 6807 To plot data within a dataframe, your plot() syntax changes slightly: plot(lifespan ~ gdp, data=df) This syntax is saying this: using the dataframe named df as a source, plot column lifespan as a function of column gdp. The symbol ~ denotes “as a function of”. This frames lifespan as a dependent variable (y axis) that is affected by the independent variable (x axis), which in this case is gdp. Another way to write this command is as follows: plot(df$lifespan ~ df$gdp) In this command, the $ symbol is saying, “give me the column in df named lifespan”. It is a handy way of referring to a column within a dataframe by name. You will learn more about working with dataframes in an upcoming module. Exercise 2 A. Use the df dataframe to produce a bar plot that shows life expectancy for each country. B. Use the df dataframe to produce a jumbled line plot of life expectancy as a function of GDP. Reference the plot() documentation to figure out how to change the thickness of the line. Next-level plotting The possibilities for data visualization in R are prety much limitless, and over time you will become fluent in making gorgeous plots. Here are a few common tools that can take your plots to the next level. Adding lines In some cases it is useful to add reference lines to your plot. For example, what if we wanted to be able to quickly see which countries had life expectancies below 75 years? You can add a line at lifespan = 75 using the function abline(). plot(df$lifespan ~ df$gdp) abline(h=75) In this command, the h input means “place a horizontal line at this y value.”. Similarly, you can use v to specify vertical lines at certain x values. plot(df$lifespan ~ df$gdp) abline(v=c(25000,35000),lty=3) Note here that another input, lty, was used to change the type of line printed. (Refer to ?abline() for more details). Exercise 4 Produce a plot of life expectancy as a function of GDP per capita. Then add a line to your plot that indicates which countries have per-capita GDPs that fall below (or above) the average per-capita GDP for the whole dataset. Make your line dashed and color it red. Adding text Use the text() function to add labels to your plot: plot(df$lifespan ~ df$gdp) text(x=30000,y=75,labels=&quot;My text went here&quot;) Exercise 5 Produce a plot of life expectancy as a function of GDP per capita, then label each point by country. Make the labels small and place them to the right of their associated dot (Hint: use ?text for help). Highlighting certain data points It can be helpful to highlight a certain data point (or group of data points) using a different dot size, format, or color. To highlight a single data point, here is one approach you can take: first, plot all points, then re-plot the point of interest using the points() function: plot(df$lifespan ~ df$gdp) points(x=df$gdp[5],y=df$lifespan[5],col=&quot;red&quot;,pch=16,cex=1.5) In this example, we re-plotted the data for the fifth row in the dataframe (in this case, China). To highlight a group of data points, try this approach: First, create a vector that will contain the color for each data point. Second, determine the color for each data point using a logical test. Third, use your vector of colors within your plot() command. For example, let’s highlight all countries whose life expectancy is greater than 75. # First cols &lt;- rep(&quot;grey&quot;,times=length(lifespan)) # create a vector of colors the length of vector `lifespan` cols [1] &quot;grey&quot; &quot;grey&quot; &quot;grey&quot; &quot;grey&quot; &quot;grey&quot; &quot;grey&quot; &quot;grey&quot; # Second change_these &lt;- which(lifespan &gt; 75) change_these # these are the elements that we want to highlight [1] 1 3 5 6 cols[change_these] &lt;- &quot;red&quot; # change the color for these elements to a highlight color # Third plot(lifespan ~ gdp,pch=16,col=cols,log=&quot;x&quot;) Exercise 6 Produce a plot of life expectancy as a function of GDP per capita, in which all countries with GDPs below $10,000 have larger dots of a different color. Building a plot from the ground up In many applications it can be helpful to have complete control over the way your plot is built. To do so, you can build your plot from the very bottom up in multiple steps. The steps for building up your own plot are as follows: Stage a blank canvas: A plot begins with a blank canvas that covers a certain range of values for x and y. To stage a blank canvas, add this parameters to your plot() function: type=\"n\", axes=FALSE, ann=FALSE, xlim=c(__, __), ylim=c(__, __)\". These commands tell R to plot a blank space, not to print axes, not to print annotations like x- or y-axis labels, and to limit your canvas to a certain coordinate range. Be sure to add numbers to the xlim() and ylim()commands. Add your axes, if you want, using the function axis(). The command axis(1) prints the x-axis, and axis(2) prints the y-axis. This function allows you to define where tick marks occur and other details (see ?axis). Add axis titles using the function title(). Add reference lines, if you want, using abline(). Do this before adding data, since it is usually nice for data points to be superimposed on top of your reference lines. Add your data using either points() or lines(). Add text labels, if you want, using text(). Here is an example of this process: # 1. Stage a blank canvas par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,1,1)) plot(1,type=&quot;n&quot;,axes=FALSE,ann=FALSE,xlim=c(0,100000),ylim=c(40,100)) # 2. Add axes axis(1,at=c(0,20000,40000,60000,80000,100000),labels=c(&quot;$0&quot;, &quot;$20&quot;,&quot;$40&quot;,&quot;$60&quot;,&quot;$80&quot;,&quot;$100&quot;)) axis(2,at=seq(40,100,by=10),las=2) # 3. Add axis titles title(xlab=&quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP, in thousands) per Capita &quot;,cex.lab=.9) title(ylab=&quot;Average Life Expectancy&quot;,cex.lab=.9) # 4. Add reference lines abline(h=70,v=50000,lty=3,col=&quot;grey&quot;) # 5. Add data points(x=gdp,y=lifespan,pch=16,col=&quot;firebrick&quot;) # 6. Add text text(x=gdp[6],y=lifespan[6],labels=&quot;Norway&quot;,pos=3) Review assignment NOTE: Under construction!

Basics A for loop is a super powerful coding tool. In a for loop, R loops through a chunk of code for a set number of repititions. A super basic example: x &lt;- 1:5 for(i in x){ print(i) } [1] 1 [1] 2 [1] 3 [1] 4 [1] 5 Here’s an example of a pretty useless for loop: for(i in 1:5){ print(&quot;I&#39;m just repeating myself.&quot;) } [1] &quot;I&#39;m just repeating myself.&quot; [1] &quot;I&#39;m just repeating myself.&quot; [1] &quot;I&#39;m just repeating myself.&quot; [1] &quot;I&#39;m just repeating myself.&quot; [1] &quot;I&#39;m just repeating myself.&quot; This code is saying: - For each iteration of this loop, step to the next value in x (first example) or 1:5 (second example). - Store that value in an object i, - and run the code inside the curly brackets. - Repeat until the end of x. Look at the basic structure: - In thefor( ) parenthetical, you tell R what values to step through (x), and how to refer to the value in each iteration (i). - Within the curly brackets, you place the chunk of code you want to repeat. Another basic example, demonsrating that you can update a variable repeatedly in a loop. x &lt;- 2 for(i in 1:5){ x &lt;- x*x print(x) } [1] 4 [1] 16 [1] 256 [1] 65536 [1] 4294967296 Another silly example: professors &lt;- c(&quot;Keri&quot;,&quot;Deb&quot;,&quot;Ken&quot;) for(x in professors){ print(paste0(x,&quot; is pretty cool!&quot;)) } [1] &quot;Keri is pretty cool!&quot; [1] &quot;Deb is pretty cool!&quot; [1] &quot;Ken is pretty cool!&quot; Exercise 1 Use this space to practice the basics of for loop formatting. First, create a vector of names (add at least 3) # Add your names to this vector famous.names &lt;- c(&quot;Lady Gaga&quot;,&quot;David Haskell&quot;,&quot;Tom Cruise&quot;) Using the examples above as a guide, create a for loop that prints the same silly statement about each of these names. # Do your coding here for(i in famous.names){ print(paste0(i,&quot; has cooties!&quot;)) } [1] &quot;Lady Gaga has cooties!&quot; [1] &quot;David Haskell has cooties!&quot; [1] &quot;Tom Cruise has cooties!&quot; Using for loops with data These silly examples above do a poor job of demonstrating how powerful a for loop can be. Multi-panel plots For example, a for loop can be a very efficient way of making multi-panel plots. Let’s use a for loop to get a quick overview of the variables included in the airquality dataset built into R. data(airquality) head(airquality) Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 6 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 Looks like the first four columns would be interesting to plot. par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Setup a multi-panel plot # format = c(number of rows, number of columns) par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,1,1)) # Set plot margins for(i in 1:4){ y &lt;- airquality[,i] var.name &lt;- names(airquality)[i] plot(y,xlab=&quot;Day&quot;,ylab=var.name,pch=16) } par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # restore the default single-panel plot Tricky plot solutions for loops are also useful for plotting data in tricky ways. Let’s use a different built-in dataset, that shows the performance of various car make/models. data(mtcars) head(mtcars) mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 Let’s say we want to see how gas mileage is affected by the number of cylinders a car has. It would be nice to create a plot that shows the raw data as well as the mean mileage for each cylinder number. # Let&#39;s see how many different cylinder types there are in the data ucyl &lt;- unique(mtcars$cyl) ; ucyl [1] 6 4 8 # Let&#39;s make an empty plot plot(1,type=&quot;n&quot;, # tell R not to draw anything xlim=c(2,10),ylim=c(0,50), xlab=&quot;Number of cylinders&quot;, ylab=&quot;Gas mileage (mpg)&quot;) # Write your for loop here to add the actual data i=ucyl[1] # It&#39;s always good to use a known value of i as you build up your for loop for(i in ucyl){ # Subset the dataframe according to number of cylinders cari &lt;- mtcars[mtcars$cyl==i,] # Plot the raw data points(x=cari$cyl,y=cari$mpg,col=&quot;grey&quot;) # Superimpose the mean on top points(x=i,y=mean(cari$mpg),col=&quot;black&quot;,pch=&quot;-&quot;,cex=5,) } Exercise 2 Now try to do something similar on your own with the airquality dataset. Use for loops to create a plot with Month on the x axis and Temperature on the y axis. On this plot, depict all the temperatures recorded in each month in the color grey, then superimpose the mean temperature for each month. We will provide the empty plot, you provide the for loop: plot(1,type=&quot;n&quot;, xlim=c(3,10),ylim=c(40,100), xlab=&quot;Month&quot;, ylab=&quot;Yemperature&quot;) # Write your for loop here to add the actual data for(i in airquality$Month){ airi &lt;- airquality[airquality$Month==i,] points(x=airi$Month,y=airi$Temp,pch=1,col=&quot;grey&quot;) points(x=i,y=mean(airi$Temp),pch=&quot;-&quot;,cex=5,col=&quot;black&quot;) } Using a for loop with more complex data Here’s another good example of the power of a good for loop. First, read in some cool data. kc &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/keeling-curve.csv&quot;) ; head(kc) year month day_of_month day_of_year year_dec frac_of_year CO2 1 1974 5 26 145.4890 1974.399 0.3986 332.95 2 1974 6 2 152.4970 1974.418 0.4178 332.35 3 1974 6 9 159.5050 1974.437 0.4370 332.20 4 1974 6 16 166.5130 1974.456 0.4562 332.37 5 1974 6 23 173.4845 1974.475 0.4753 331.73 6 1974 6 30 180.4925 1974.495 0.4945 331.68 This is the famous Keeling Curve dataset: long-term monitoring of atmospheric CO2 measured at a volcanic observatory in Hawaii. Try plotting the Keeling Curve: plot(kc$CO2 ~ kc$year_dec,type=&quot;l&quot;,xlab=&quot;Year&quot;,ylab=&quot;Atmospheric CO2&quot;) There are some erroneous data points! We clearly can’t have negative CO2 values. Let’s remove those and try again: kc &lt;- kc[kc$CO2 &gt;0,] plot(kc$CO2 ~ kc$year_dec,type=&quot;l&quot;,xlab=&quot;Year&quot;,ylab=&quot;Atmospheric CO2&quot;) What’s the deal with those squiggles? Let’s investigate! Let’s look at the data a different way: by focusing in on a single year. # Stage an empty plot for what you are trying to represent plot(1, # plot a single point type=&quot;n&quot;, xlim=c(0,365),xlab=&quot;Day of year&quot;, ylim=c(-5,5),ylab=&quot;CO2 anomaly&quot;) abline(h=0,col=&quot;grey&quot;) # add nifty horizontal line # Reduce the dataset to a single year (any year) kcy &lt;- kc[kc$year==&quot;1990&quot;,] ; head(kcy) year month day_of_month day_of_year year_dec frac_of_year CO2 816 1990 1 7 6.4970 1990.018 0.0178 353.58 817 1990 1 14 13.5050 1990.037 0.0370 353.99 818 1990 1 21 20.5130 1990.056 0.0562 353.92 819 1990 1 28 27.4845 1990.075 0.0753 354.39 820 1990 2 4 34.4925 1990.094 0.0945 355.04 821 1990 2 11 41.5005 1990.114 0.1137 355.09 # Let&#39;s convert each CO2 reading to an &#39;anomaly&#39; compared to the year&#39;s average.

How can we include the seasonal squiggle from other years? Let’s use a for loop! OK – let’s redo that graph and add a for loop into the mix: # First, stage your empty plot: plot(1,type=&quot;n&quot;, xlim=c(0,365),xlab=&quot;Day of year&quot;, ylim=c(-5,5),ylab=&quot;CO2 anomaly&quot;) abline(h=0,col=&quot;grey&quot;) # Now we will loop through each year of data. First, get a vector of the years included in the dataset: years &lt;- unique(kc$year) ; years [1] &quot;1974&quot; &quot;1975&quot; &quot;1976&quot; &quot;1977&quot; &quot;1978&quot; &quot;1979&quot; &quot;1980&quot; &quot;1981&quot; &quot;1982&quot; &quot;1983&quot; [11] &quot;1984&quot; &quot;1985&quot; &quot;1986&quot; &quot;1987&quot; &quot;1988&quot; &quot;1989&quot; &quot;1990&quot; &quot;1991&quot; &quot;1992&quot; &quot;1993&quot; [21] &quot;1994&quot; &quot;1995&quot; &quot;1996&quot; &quot;1997&quot; &quot;1998&quot; &quot;1999&quot; &quot;2000&quot; &quot;2001&quot; &quot;2002&quot; &quot;2003&quot; [31] &quot;2004&quot; &quot;2005&quot; &quot;2006&quot; &quot;2007&quot; &quot;2008&quot; &quot;2009&quot; &quot;2010&quot; &quot;2011&quot; &quot;2012&quot; &quot;2013&quot; [41] &quot;2014&quot; &quot;2015&quot; &quot;2016&quot; &quot;2017&quot; &quot;2018&quot; &quot;2019&quot; &quot;2020&quot; &quot;2021&quot; NA # Now build your for loop. # Notice that the contents of the `for loop` are exactly the same # as the single plot above -- with one exception. # Notice the use of the symbol i for(i in years){ # Reduce the dataset to a single year kcy &lt;- kc[kc$year==i,] ; head(kcy) # Let&#39;s convert each CO2 reading to an &#39;anomaly&#39; compared to the year&#39;s average.

So how do you interpret this graph? Why does the squiggle happen every year? Review assignment First, read in and format some other cool data. The code for doing so is provided for you here: df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/renewable-energy.csv&quot;) This dataset, freely available from World Bank, shows the renewable electricity output for various countries, presented as a percentage of the nation’s total electricity output. They provide this data as a time series. 27.0.1 Summarize columns with a for loop Task 1: Use a for loop to find the change in renewable energy output for each nation in the dataset between 1990 and 2015. Print the difference for each nation in the console. # Write your code here names(df) [1] &quot;year&quot; &quot;World&quot; &quot;Australia&quot; &quot;Canada&quot; [5] &quot;China&quot; &quot;Denmark&quot; &quot;India&quot; &quot;Japan&quot; [9] &quot;New_Zealand&quot; &quot;Sweden&quot; &quot;Switzerland&quot; &quot;United_Kingdom&quot; [13] &quot;United_States&quot; i=2 for(i in 2:ncol(df)){ dfi &lt;- df[,i] ; dfi diffi &lt;- dfi[length(dfi)] - dfi[1] ; diffi print(paste0(names(df)[i],&quot; : &quot;,round(diffi),&quot;% change.&quot;)) } [1] &quot;World : 3% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Australia : 4% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Canada : 1% change.&quot; [1] &quot;China : 4% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Denmark : 62% change.&quot; [1] &quot;India : -9% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Japan : 5% change.&quot; [1] &quot;New_Zealand : 0% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Sweden : 12% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Switzerland : 7% change.&quot; [1] &quot;United_Kingdom : 23% change.&quot; [1] &quot;United_States : 2% change.&quot; Task 2: Re-do this loop, but instead of printing the differences to the console, save them in a vector. # Write your code here diffs &lt;- c() i=2 for(i in 2:ncol(df)){ dfi &lt;- df[,i] ; dfi diffi &lt;- dfi[length(dfi)] - dfi[1] ; diffi print(paste0(names(df)[i],&quot; : &quot;,round(diffi),&quot;% change.&quot;)) diffs &lt;- c(diffs,diffi) } [1] &quot;World : 3% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Australia : 4% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Canada : 1% change.&quot; [1] &quot;China : 4% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Denmark : 62% change.&quot; [1] &quot;India : -9% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Japan : 5% change.&quot; [1] &quot;New_Zealand : 0% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Sweden : 12% change.&quot; [1] &quot;Switzerland : 7% change.&quot; [1] &quot;United_Kingdom : 23% change.&quot; [1] &quot;United_States : 2% change.&quot; diffs [1] 3.49241703 3.98181045 0.63273122 3.51887728 62.33064943 -9.14624362 [7] 4.73004321 0.07524008 12.26263811 7.21543884 23.01128298 1.69994636 Multi-pane plots with for loops Practice with a single plot Task 3: First, get your bearings by figuring out how to use the df dataset to plot the time series for the United States, for the years 1990 - 2015. Label the x axis “Year” and the y axis “% Renewable”. Include the full name of the county as the main title for the plot. # Write code here head(df) year World Australia Canada China Denmark India Japan 1 1990 19.36204 9.656031 62.37872 20.40794 3.175275 24.48929 11.254738 2 1991 19.23357 10.598201 61.41041 18.47113 2.892325 22.80740 11.856735 3 1992 19.15840 10.066865 61.67921 17.58468 4.398464 20.75265 10.162888 4 1993 19.78795 10.549144 61.72233 18.12526 4.730088 19.55881 11.454528 5 1994 19.53812 10.194474 60.40045 18.08844 4.295431 21.21910 7.993026 6 1995 19.83536 9.624143 61.00410 19.21414 5.035639 17.26054 9.416323 New_Zealand Sweden Switzerland United_Kingdom United_States 1 80.00620 51.00011 54.98254 1.828767 11.528647 2 77.18945 44.30088 57.16370 1.656439 10.757414 3 72.58771 52.33321 56.90938 2.005662 9.916110 4 77.02407 52.92433 59.57279 1.777626 10.484326 5 82.05216 43.02873 60.57322 2.139842 9.747236 6 83.85281 47.57878 57.42996 2.066535 10.801085 dfi &lt;- df[,c(1,13)] plot(x=dfi[,1], y=dfi[,2], type=&quot;l&quot;,lwd=2, xlim=c(1990,2015),ylim=c(0,100), xlab=&quot;Year&quot;,ylab=&quot;% renewable&quot;, main=names(dfi)[2]) Now loop it! Task 4: Use that code as the foundation for building up a for loop that displays the same time series for every country in the dataset on a multi-pane graph that with 4 rows and 3 columns. par(mfrow=c(4,3)) i=3 for(i in 2:ncol(df)){ dfi &lt;- df[,c(1,i)] ; dfi plot(x=dfi[,1], y=dfi[,2], type=&quot;l&quot;,lwd=2, xlim=c(1990,2015),ylim=c(0,100), xlab=&quot;Year&quot;,ylab=&quot;% renewable&quot;, main=names(dfi)[2]) } Now loop it differently! Task 5: Now try a different presentation. Instead of producing 12 different plots, superimpose the time series for each country on the same single plot. To add some flare, highlight the USA curve by coloring it red and making it thicker. par(mfrow=c(1,1)) plot(1,type=&quot;n&quot;,lwd=2, xlim=c(1990,2015),ylim=c(0,100), xlab=&quot;Year&quot;,ylab=&quot;% Renewable&quot;) for(i in 2:ncol(df)){ dfi &lt;- df[,c(1,i)] ; dfi lines(dfi[,2]~dfi[,1],lwd=2,col=adjustcolor(&quot;black&quot;,alpha.f=.5)) } lines(df$United_States~df$year,lwd=4,col=&quot;red&quot;) "],["writing-functions.html", "Module 28 Writing functions Learning goals Introduction Review assignment Other Resources", " Module 28 Writing functions Learning goals Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Introduction Exercise 1 Review assignment Other Resources "],["working-with-text.html", "Module 29 Working with text", " Module 29 Working with text "],["working-with-dates-times.html", "Module 30 Working with dates &amp; times", " Module 30 Working with dates &amp; times "],["working-with-factors.html", "Module 31 Working with factors", " Module 31 Working with factors "],["cleaning-messy-data.html", "Module 32 Cleaning messy data", " Module 32 Cleaning messy data "],["matrices-lists.html", "Module 33 Matrices &amp; lists", " Module 33 Matrices &amp; lists "],["pipes.html", "Module 34 Pipes", " Module 34 Pipes "],["exporting-data-plots.html", "Module 35 Exporting data &amp; plots", " Module 35 Exporting data &amp; plots "],["intro-to-shiny-apps.html", "Module 36 Intro to Shiny apps", " Module 36 Intro to Shiny apps "],["shiny-dashboards.html", "Module 37 Shiny dashboards", " Module 37 Shiny dashboards "],["data-entry-apps.html", "Module 38 Data entry apps", " Module 38 Data entry apps "],["introduction-2.html", "Module 39 Introduction 39.1 What 39.2 Why 39.3 When 39.4 When not", " Module 39 Introduction 39.1 What 39.2 Why 39.3 When 39.4 When not "],["platforms.html", "Module 40 Platforms 40.1 PostgreSQL 40.2 mySQL 40.3 SQLite", " Module 40 Platforms 40.1 PostgreSQL 40.2 mySQL 40.3 SQLite "],["alternatives.html", "Module 41 Alternatives 41.1 NoSQL", " Module 41 Alternatives 41.1 NoSQL "],["practices.html", "Module 42 Practices", " Module 42 Practices Spinning up a local DB "],["r-markdown.html", "Module 43 R Markdown", " Module 43 R Markdown "],["reproducible-research.html", "Module 44 Reproducible research", " Module 44 Reproducible research "],["automated-reporting.html", "Module 45 Automated reporting", " Module 45 Automated reporting "],["formatting-standards.html", "Module 46 Formatting standards 46.1 Tables 46.2 Figures 46.3 Captions", " Module 46 Formatting standards 46.1 Tables 46.2 Figures 46.3 Captions "],["what-is-version-control.html", "Module 47 What is version control?", " Module 47 What is version control?
