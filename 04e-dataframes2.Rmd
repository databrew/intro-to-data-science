# Dataframe wrangling {#dplyr}

#### Learning goals {-}

* Understand the importance of *tidy* dataframes
* Understand what the `tidyverse` is and why it is awesome
* Feel comfortable working with dataframes using `dplyr` functions.


## The `dplyr` package {-}

Data scientists largely work in data frames and _do things_ to data. This is what the package `dplyr` is optimized for. It consists of a series of "verbs" which cover 95% of what you need to do for most basic data processing tasks. 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr') # if you haven't yet
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

The `dplyr` package contains a set of `verbs`: things you do to dataframes. Those verbs are:

- **`filter()`**  
- **`arrange()`**  
- **`select()`**   
- **`rename()`**  
- **`distinct()`**  
- **`mutate()`**   
- **`summarise()`**  

## The `%>%` pipe {-}

**`%>%`** is a "pipe". It is a way to write code without so many parentheses. For example, what if I want to find the square root of the sum of the first six elements of a sequence of 10 to 20 by 2?

Here's what that command would look like in base `R`:  

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
sqrt(sum(head(seq(10, 20, 2))))
```

Pretty overwhelming, and pretty easy to make errors in writing it out. 

But the above could also be written a simpler way:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
seq(10, 20, 2) %>% head %>% sum %>% sqrt
```

When you see the **`%>%`** pipe symbol, think of the word **"then"**. 

The above code could be read aloud like so: "First, get a sequence of every second number between 10 and 20. **Then**, take the first six values. **Then**, sum those samples together. **Then**, take the square root of that sum." 

Using the `%>%` pipe framework, your code turns from a nonlinear series of parentheses and brackets to a linear progression of steps, which is a closer fit to how we tend to think about working with data. Instead of working from the inside of a command outward, we thinking linearly: take the data, **then** do things with it, **then** do more things with it, etc.

Here's another example:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
mean(sd(1:100))
```

... could also be written as:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
1:100 %>% sd %>% mean
```

## `dplyr` verbs {-}

To practice the `dplyr` verbs, let's make a small dataframe named `people`:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people <- data.frame(who = c('Joe', 'Ben', 'Xing', 'Coloma'),
                    sex = c('Male', 'Male', 'Female', 'Female'),
                    age = c(35, 33, 32, 34))
people
```

### `filter()` {-}

The `filter()` function is used to subset a dataframe, retaining all rows that satisfy your conditions. To be retained, the row must produce a value of `TRUE` for all conditions. 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% filter(sex == 'Male')
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% filter(sex == 'Female')
```

You can also filter according to multiple conditions. Here are three ways to acheive the same thing:  

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% filter(sex == 'Female' & age < 33)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% filter(sex == 'Female', age < 33)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% filter(sex == 'Female') %>% filter(age < 33)
```

Note that when a condition evaluates to `NA`, its row will be dropped. This differ from the base subsetting works with `[ ... ]`.

### `arrange()` {-}

Arrange means putting things in order. That is, `arrange()` orders the rows of a data frame by the values of selected columns.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% arrange(age)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% arrange(sex)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% arrange(who)
```

To reverse the order, use `desc()`: 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% arrange(desc(age))
```

You can also arrange by multiple levels: 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% arrange(sex, age)
```


### `select()` {-}

Select only certain variables in a data frame, making the dataframe skinnier (fewer columns). 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% select(age)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% select(sex, age)
```

As you select columns, you can rename them like so:  

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% select(sex, years = age)
```

You can also select a set of columns using the `:` notation:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% select(who:sex)
```


### `rename()` {-}

The function `rename()` changes the names of individual variables.  

This verb takes the syntax `<new_name> = <old_name>` syntax.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% rename(gender = sex, years = age, first_name = who)
```


### `mutate()` {-}

The function `mutate()` adds new variables and preserves existing ones. 

New variables overwrite existing variables of the same name. 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% mutate(agein2020 = age - 1)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% mutate(is_male = sex == 'Male')
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% mutate(average_age = mean(age))
```

You can call `mutate()` multiple times in the same pipe:  

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% mutate(average_age = mean(age)) %>%
  mutate(diff_from_avg = age - average_age)
```

You can also remove variables can be removed by setting their value to NULL.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% mutate(age = NULL)
```

A similar function, `transmute()`, adds new variables and drops existing ones, kind of like a combination of `select()` and `mutate()`.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% transmute(average_age = mean(age))
```


### `group_by()` {-}

Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables. The function `group_by()` takes an existing table and converts it into a grouped one where operations are performed "by group". 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(average_age_for_sex = mean(age)) 
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(average_age_for_sex = mean(age)) %>%
  mutate(diff_from_avg_for_sex = age - average_age_for_sex)
```

Note that a similar verb, `ungroup()`, removes grouping.

### `summarize()` {-} 

`summarize()` or `summarize()` creates an entirely new data frame. It will have one (or more) rows for each combination of grouping variables; if there are no grouping variables, the output will have a single row summarizing all observations in the input. It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column for each of the summary statistics that you have specified.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% 
  summarize(average_age = mean(age))
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% 
  summarize(average_age = mean(age),
            standard_dev_of_age = sd(age),
            oldest_age = max(age),
            youngest_age = min(age))
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(avg_age = mean(age),
            oldest_age = max(age),
            total_years = sum(age)) 
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
people %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(sample_size = n())
```

Note the use of the function, **`n()`**. This simple function counts up the number of records in each group.  

```{r, results = 'asis', eval = ifelse(exists('is_teacher'),is_teacher,TRUE),echo=FALSE}
source('teacher_tip.R')

tip <- 'To illustrate these `dplyr` verbs and re-energize the room, ask everyone to stand. Tell the students that they represent a dataframe called `people`.

#### Exercises {-}

Answer these questions using the new `dplyr` verbs you just learned:  

**Baby names over time**  

**1.** Run the below code to load a dataset about baby names given in the USA since the 1800's.  

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(babynames)
bn <- babynames
```

**2.**  Check out the first and last six rows of `bn`.  

**3.**  What are the names of the variables in this dataset?  

**4.**  How many rows are in this dataset?  

**5.**  What is the earliest year in this dataset?  

**6.**  Create a dataframe named `turn_of_century`, which contain data only for the year 1900. 

**7.**  Create a dataframe named `boys`, containing only boys. 

**8.**  Create a dataframe named `moms_gen`. This should be females born in the year of birth of your mom.

**9.**  Order `moms_gen` by `n`, in ascending order (i.e., with the least popular name at top). Look at the result; what is the least popular name among women the year your mom was born?

**10.**  Reverse the order and save the result into an object named `moms_gen_ordered`.

**11.**  Create an object named `boys2k`. This should be all males born in the year 2000.

**12.**  Arrange `boys2k` from most to least popular. What was the most popular boys name in 2000?

**13.**  What percentage of boys were named `Joseph` in 2000?

**14.**  Were there more Jims or Matthews in 2020?

**15.** Create an object named `tot_names_by_year`, which contains the total counts for boy and girl names assigned in each year of the dataset. You should have four columns: `year`, `boys`, `girls`, and `tot`. 

**16.**  How many people were born with _your_ name in 2020?

**17.** Was your name more prevalent in 2020 than it was in the year you were born?

**18.** What if you account for the changing overall population size? In other words, is the *proportional prevalence* of your name greater in 2020 or your birth year?

**19.** In which year was your name the most prevalent?  

**20.** Create a basic plot of the proportional prevalence of your name since the earliest year of this dataset.  

**21.** Update this plot with lines for your parent's names and your siblings names, if you have any.

**22.** Format that plot so that it is gorgeous and well-labelled. 

**23.** Screenshot it and email it to your family.
