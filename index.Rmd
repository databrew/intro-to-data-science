# Welcome!

Welcome to  ``DataBOOM``, a curriculum designed to guide you from your very first line of code towards becoming a professional data scientist. 


## What this is, and what it isn't {-}

This is not a textbook or a reference manual. It is not exhaustive or comprehensive. It is a *training manual* designed to *empower researchers to do impactful data science.* As such, its tutorials and exercises aim to get you, the researcher, to start writing your own code as quickly as possible and -- equally of importance -- to *start thinking like a data scientist*, by which we mean tackling ambiguous problems with persistence, independence, and creative problem solving.  

Furthermore, this is not a fancy interactive tutorial with bells or whistles. It was purposefully designed to be simple and "analog". You will not be typing your code into this website and getting feedback from a robot, or setting up an account to track your progress, or getting pretty merit badges or points when you complete each module.  

Instead, you will be doing your work on your own machine, working with real folders and files, downloading data and moving it around, etc. -- all the things you will be doing as a data scientist in the real world.


## Who this is for {-}

This curriculum covers everything from the absolute basics of writing code in `R` to machine learning with `tensorflow`. As such, it is designed to be useful to everyone in some way. But the target audience for these tutorials is the student who *wants* to work with data but has *zero* formal training in programming, computer science, or statistics.  

This curriculum was originally developed for the [**DataLab**](www.new.sewanee.edu/sewanee-datalab) at Sewanee: The University of the South, TN, USA.


## What you will learn {-}

- The **Core theory** unit establishes the conceptual foundations and motivations for this work: what data science is, why it matters, and ethical issues surrounding it: the good, the bad, and the ugly.


The next several units comprise a *core* curriculum for tackling data science problems:  

- The **Getting started** unit teaches you how to use `R` (in `RStudio`). Here you will add the first and most important tools to your toolbox: working with variables, vectors, dataframes, scripts, and file directories.  

- The **Basic `R` workflow** unit teaches you how to bring in your own data and work with it in `R`. You will learn how to produce beautiful plots and how to reorganize, filter, and summarize your datasets. You will also learn how to conduct basic statistics, from exploratory data analyses (e.g., producing and comparing distributions) to significance testing.  

- The **Review exercises** unit provides various puzzles that allow you to apply the basic `R` skills from the previous unit to fun questions and scenarios. In each of these exercises, questions are arranged in increasing order of difficulty, so that beginners will not feel stuck right out of the gate, nor will experienced coders become bored. This is where you really begin to cut your teeth on real-world data puzzles: figuring out how to use the `R` tools in your toolbag to tackle an ambiguous problem and deliver an excellent data product.  

- The **Reproducible research** unit equips you with basic tools needed for truly reproducible data science: documenting your research and code with `Markdown`, weaving together your code and your reporting with `RMarkdown`, 
allowing users to explore the data themselves with an interactive `Shiny` dashboard or web app, and sharing your code and tracking versions of your code using `Git`.  

- The **Presenting research** unit teaches you how to produce well-organized and well-written research reports, and how to deliver compelling presentations about your work.  

- The final unit, **Deep `R`**, introduces you to a variety of more involved `R` tools and advanced data science techniques, from writing custom functions and `for` loops to producing interactive maps, iterative simulations, and machine learning algorithms.

source('teacher_tip.R')

tip <- 'Here are a few general strategies that should work with nearly every module in this curriculum:  <br><br>  (1) Use the module as your lecture notes. Read them on your own screen, or from the printed version of this book, as you manually type each command into a blank `Rstudio` window on the screen you are sharing with the students. The R script you make as you teach becomes a record of your lecture notes. <br><br> (2) Invite the students to follow along with you, writing the code into `Rstudio` themselves on their own computers. <br><br> (3) Once you introduce the concept of `R` scripts in a few modules, begin each class by opening up a new script and saving it with a simple name that reflects the module. Alternatively, ask students to do this before class begins, so that you can rock and roll immediately. <br><br> (4) We recommend setting up a Slack channel for your class. Have Slack open during instruction, so that students can copy and paste errors into a public channel. This will make it easy to address questions, and it will open up the possibility that students will help those who are stuck on their own. <br><br> (5) Plan for (i) very little time spent on teaching a module, and (ii) a large amount of time reserved for working through the exercises at the end of each module. When you transition from teaching to introducing the exercises, share the link to the module so that students can reference the module as they work.  <br><br> (6) If there is time, once students have the chance to tackle the exercises on their own, work through them together as a group.
