# Presentations

Short presentations on previous research / work are an increasingly common aspect of job interviews. Design your words, your slides, and your presentation as a whole as if you were giving this talk to a selection committee at a potential employer or graduate school. . 

Ensure that...
1. You do not speak for more than 9 minutes. 
2. You allocate substantial attention and time to your results -- at least 3 minutes of your talk should be presenting and discussing figures and tables.
3. You make it clear that you have practiced this talk and prepared for it well.
4. You make it clear that you are invested in this project and that you have designed it to be a challenging but constructive experience.
5. You are prepared for 2 - 3 minutes of questions from the professors and juniors.
