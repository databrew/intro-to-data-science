# Sections of a report

## Learning goals {-}

* Understand the over-arching structure and narrative flow of a research paper  
* How to write each section of a paper  


## Overall structure  {-}

Data reports, research papers, and scientific publications follow the same basic narrative flow:

* **Abstract**: Concise summary. This section can also be referred to as an *Overview* or *Executive Summary*. 
* **Introduction**: A background section that provides context and justifies the ways that the report is important and adds value.  
* **Methods**: Detailed description of what was done and how data were analyzed.  
* **Results**: A concise report of what was found, drawing upon narrative prose, data tables, and figures.
* **Discussion**: Considerations and interpretations of the results' significance, limitations, and consequences for the field of study.
* **Other stuff**: Acknowledgments, literature cited (i.e., references), tables, and figures.

These sections map onto a high-level conceptual flow: a **research paper is like an hourglass.** 

![](img/hourglass.png){width=50%}

Your *Intro* narrows from a point of common and general interest to an articulation of a *specific* knowledge cap and a *focused* purpose. Your focus remains narrow as you cover your study's *Methods* and *Results*. Only in the *Discussion* does your paper begin expanding out again to place your findings in the context of other studies and consider your findings' implications on broader issues. Your paper ends as broadly as it began: a point of common interest and importance, this time focused on future concerns and priorities.  

In this module, we will cover how to adhere to this narrative arc while meeting the standards and expectations of each individual section.  


## Abstract {-}

An *Abstract* is a concise and sharp distillation of your paper.   

#### Standards {-}

A strong *Abstract* section will answer *"Hell yes!"* to all of the following questions:

**1. Is your abstract actually a helpful overview?** That is, is your abstract a *specific summary of your paper's content*, rather than a vague overview of its organization? As a good example of what *NOT* to do, a geologist published the following sarcastic abstract in 1954: 

![](img/abstracts.png)

Avoid this style! There is a way to summarize that avoids any helpful information, and there is a way to summarize the provides an *executive summary* of your work. Aim for the latter. 

**2. Does your abstract adhered to the Abstract Recipe** detailed below?  
**3. Does your abstract fit within the word limits** provided by the assignment or instructions? Most *Abstract* word limits range between 250 and 300 words. 


#### Strategies {-} 

There are hundreds of approaches to writing an *Abstract*. (for proof, just type "how to write an abstract" into *GoogleScholar*!) We recommend the following approach:   

In a strong *Abstract*, every single sentence serves a specific purpose, outlined in the following **Abstract Recipe:**

- **Sentence 1:** establishes broad interest and the relevance of your topic.  
- **Sentence 2:** articulates your problem statement.  
- **Sentence 3:** articulates your research question and study objectives.  
- **Sentence 4:** summarizes your data collection methods.  
- **Sentence 5:** summarizes your statistical approach.  
- **Results sentences:** The next few sentences (2 - 4) summarize your most important results.  
- **Discussion sentences:** Use one to two sentences to explain the importance and implications of your findings.  
- **Final sentence:** summarizes recommendations for future research. “Future research on this topic should focus on…”  

Like a professional chef, professional academics may adjust this recipe as they see fit, but nearly all good abstracts conform to this general formula.

## Introduction {-}

An *Introduction* is an information-rich and persuasive *argument* for the importance of the contribution your paper will be making to the field of study.


#### Standards {-}

An *Introduction* has to do many things at once. Here are the necessary elements of a quality *Intro*:  

1. **Engage & Justify.** The entire Introduction is a carefully crafted, convincing argument for the importance of your topic and the urgent need for your research.  

2. **Establish context & convince readers to care.** Early into the Intro, place your topic in a broad context. Make it clear who should be interested in your topic.  

3. **Invite readers in.** A good Intro is an accessible one; it should not send the message that only experts will get something out of the paper.   

4. **Get everyone on the same page.** Mention and explain any concepts that will be crucial to understanding your methodology, interpreting your results, or intuiting the impact of your work.

5. **Demonstrate authoritative knowledge.** Demonstrate exhaustive knowledge of the topic, and sharp awareness of the ‘state of the science’.

6. **Demonstrate basis in previous research.** Aim for a 1:1 ratio. Each sentence should end with a citation. *(See Literature Review details below.)*

7. **Provide more than a history lesson or a list of facts.** Your Introduction is a tightly organized and persuasive argument, not a brain dump. Your deep knowledge of the field ought to be sprinkled throughout.

8. **Narrow in on a problem statement.** The entire Intro should narrow to a *problem statement* (a knowledge gap, an urgent need). Along the way, you are garnering reader buy-in (yes, this is important) which causes them to care about the gap you have identified.  

*Examples of problem statements:*
- Example 1 *(under construction)*
- Example 2 *(under construction)*
- Example 3 *(under construction)*

9. **Follow with a motivation/objectives statement.** Your study is a response to the problem statement. “To address this knowledge gap, I developed a study based upon the following objectives…”  


#### Strategies {-} 

With so much to cover in an Introduction, it can be difficult to know where to begin. There are two main steps to preparing an *Introduction*: (1) revieweing literature, and (2) writing. Begin with the literature.  


##### Conducting a literature review {-}

Carrying out a literature review can be daunting, especially if you are new to a field of study.  

But regardless of your level of experience, you can follow a **common basic workflow:**  

**Dive into the literature,** follow rabbit holes, and take notes until you begin to feel familiar with the canon of knowledge on your topic. That feeling of familiarity will come once you stop finding new studies in the literature cited sections of the papers you are reading, and once you start to recognize the names of the most prolific and influential scientists in your topic of interest.  

**1. Find your first paper to review.** Begin your search on *GoogleScholar* [scholar.google.com](scholar.google.com). You may need to search other search engines eventually (e.g., JStor, PubMed, etc.), but this is a good place to start.  

The most productive starting point is looking for recent *review* articles on your topic. Reviews try to be definitive and exhaustive in their list of references. They also point to the studies that were foundationally important in the early days of your topic, as well as to the "cutting edge": the most recent and exciting developments in the literature.  

**2. Open up a scratchpad for taking notes** in *Word* or *GoogleDocs*. Type (or screenshot) the citation for your first article to the top of your scratchpad (e.g., Keen EM and Brew JR. 2021. Ping pong: the Sport of Kings? *Table Tennis Weekly* 56(1): 343-356.)  

**3. Begin reading & taking notes.** Don't sit down to read it word for word. Read it *selectively* for the topics and details that are most relevant to your work. If your first paper is a research article (i.e., with sections on Methods and Results) instead of a review, focus on its Introduction and Discussion.  Your notes should be brief. If you are copying language from the paper word for word, place it in quotes so that you can remember what needs to be paraphrased at a later time. In each note that involves a reference to a separate article, include that reference in your note (e.g., 
Puckette et al. 2021) so you can track it later.  

**4. Copy down all references** that are included in your notes using the literature cited section. This can be tedious but it will pay off in the long run.  

**5. Clean up your notes for this first paper.** Make sure *every single* note has a parenthetical citation attached to it, so you don't lose track of where it came from. If the note is a direct contribution from the paper you have reviewed, add the reference for that paper to your note (e.g., Keen & Brew 2021).   

**6. Select one of these references as your *second* paper to review.**  

**7. Repeat.** Until you begin to feel familiar with the current literature and stop being suprised by new studies. 

*Once you reach a familiarity plateau (shoot for 80% expertise), pause your literature review!* Anything less than 20-30 reviewed papers is highly unlikely to provide a sufficient grasp of the state of your field of study.   


##### Organizing and writing your Introduction {-}

You now know enough about the literature now to have a basic sense of what is currently known and not know about your topic. 

**8. Write your problem statement,** the *gap in knowledge* the justifies and motivates your study. 

**9. Articulate your hypotheses and/or objectives** Frame these as a way of *addressing* or *ameliorating* the problem statement.

**10. Determine your starting point.** Choose your audience, your hook, and the initial direction of your conceptual flow. This is arguably the most difficult part of the writing process. 

**11. Outline the narrative path from your starting point to your problem statement,** with the key step in your argumentative arc must be, and therefore what the purpose of each paragraph must be. 

**12. For each paragraph, articulate the main point or key idea.** This sentence can typically serve as the first sentence of the paragraph (or in some cases the last).

**13. Sort your notes into each paragraph.** Some notes may be useful in multiple paragraphs, in which case you can copy them rather than just moving them. This is why it is *critical* that you add a parenthetical citation for the source of each reference. Otherwise you will lose track of which content comes from which source!

**13. Sort your notes *within* each paragraph.** Each paragraph has its own narrative flow, taking the reader from concept A to concept B using a *sequence* or *chain* of evidence-based claims. How do your notes need to be organized in order to build that chain?

**14. Determine the *holes* in your literature review.** As you organize your notes into an argumentative sequence, you will find "holes" in your argument that require substantiation with an as-yet undiscovered reference. This will guide your *second stage* of literature review (see next steps).

**15. Now begins an iterative process** of writing, seeking new references, and reorganizing your writing. Iterate until satisfied.

## Methods {-}

Your *Methods* section provides all the detail necessary to (1) understand how you collected data, (2) understand how you analyzed the data, (3) how to interpret the results, and (4) reproduce your study (at least in principle).


#### Standards {-}

A strong *Methods* section will answer *"Hell yes!"* to all of the following questions:

**1. Do your methods make sense** based upon the research question and the objectives stated in your Introduction? For example, if your goal is to understand the risks of a new drug, it would not make sense if you were measuring seismic activity near a volcano. That's a dumb example, but you get the idea: what you *do* should actually answer your *research question*.

**2. Is your research and analysis fully reproducible**, based upon the level of detail and quality of explanation in your Methods section?

**3. Is your analytical approach appropriate** given your objectives and the limitations of your data? For example, if you are interested in the correlation between two variables, it would not make sense to use a *t-test*.

**4. Is your analytical approach properly thorough?** Are you doing everything you can with the data you have, within the confines of a your project's scope and objectives? Data are valuable and difficult to come by. Are you learning everything you can regarding your research question from the data you have collected?  (*Note that it is possible to go too far here, i.e., to include analyses that have nothing to do with your research question. The key is to be thorough but focused.*)

**5. Is your Methods section written clearly, concisely, and with precision?**  

#### Strategies {-} 

Your *Methods* section will likely be the thing you write second, immediately after you develop your research question, objectives, and hypotheses.

## Results {-}

#### Standards {-}

A strong *Results* section will answer *"Hell yes!"* to all of the following questions:

**1. Are your results complete** based on the analyses you described in your Methods section?  
**2. Is your Results section organized as a coherent narrative** that is directly related to your research question, and not just a list of seemingly random findings?  
**3. Are your findings and conclusion *appropriate*,** given the limitations of the data and the methods you employed?  
**4. Are tables and figures included where appropriate?**  
**5. Are tables and figures referenced correctly** within the text of your results?  
**6. Does your Results section contain results *only*,** and not any methodological details or interpretation commentary that would be more appropriate in the Discussion section?  
**7. Is your Results section written clearly and with precision?**

## Discussion {-}

#### Standards {-}

A strong *Discussion* section will have the following components or subsections:

**The opening paragraph** is a brief summary of your most important results that highlights the findings that make your study important. Think of this paragraph as a ‘hook’ that convinces readers they should read the rest of your Discussion.

**Subsection on Study Limitations.** This subsection allows you to (1) place boundaries on how you are able to interpret your results given the limitations or unexpected issues that arose from your methods, and (2) identity areas in which your study could be improved if it were reproduced in the future.

**Subsection on Interpretation of Results.** Use this subsection as an area to highlight and explore your findings, what they mean, and what the important takeaways are.

**Subsection on Comparison to Previous Studies.** Use this subsection to place your findings within the context of other research. Are your results in line with previous findings? Are they surprising? If so, why might that be? If it is difficult to compare your study to others, explain why. This is a chance for you to control the conversation in the event that others try to compare your study to other literature. 

**Subsection on Study Implications.**  Use this subsection to articulate how your findings relate to your study objectives, address your research question, and are important in a broad sense. Why do your results matter? What implications do they have for the issues, places, and people you are focused on in this project? How might your findings influence future policies, technological innovations, or other changes?

**Subsection on Suggestions for Future Research** with a concluding statement that reinforces the importance and contribution of your project.

## Presentations {-}

Short presentations on previous research / work are an increasingly common aspect of job interviews. Design your words, your slides, and your presentation as a whole as if you were giving this talk to a selection committee at a potential employer or graduate school. . 

Ensure that...
1. You do not speak for more than 9 minutes. 
2. You allocate substantial attention and time to your results -- at least 3 minutes of your talk should be presenting and discussing figures and tables.
3. You make it clear that you have practiced this talk and prepared for it well.
4. You make it clear that you are invested in this project and that you have designed it to be a challenging but constructive experience.
5. You are prepared for 2 - 3 minutes of questions from the professors and juniors.
