- How to document your projects with `Markdown`, and why doing so is so important.


## What is 'reproducible research'? {-}

Reproducible research is the idea that work done by scientist A is "reproducible" by scientist B. In other words, if the findings of the research are of any generalizable value, then the results of two scientists working on the same problem should be identical (or very high in agreement).

In practice, this means using data and code in a structured, well-documented, accessible, clear way, and ensuring that others can do the same.

## Why does reproducible research matter? {-}

Reproducible research matters for lots of reasons:

1. Because making your work reproducible means that _you_ will have less problems returning to that work at a later time.  
2. Because making your work reproducible means that _others_ can collaborate with you, help you, error-check you, and build on your work.  
3. Because making your work reproducible means you are fighting the plague of irreproducible results which have characterized the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis)

## How to carry out reproducible research {-}

- Make your code open source  
- Put your stuff on github  
- Use open source tools  
- Use free tools  
- Document everything you do  
- Collaborate with others

### Final thoughts {-}

An article about RESULTS is advertising, not scholarship. An article with transparent, reproducible methods is scholarship.
