## RStudio's *Console* {-}

When you open `RStudio`, you see several different panes within the program's window. You will get a tour of `RStudio` in the next module. For now, look at the left half of the screen. You should see a large pane entitled the *Console*.   

![](img/rstudio_firstopen.png)

`RStudio`'s *Console* is your window into `R`, the engine under the hood. The *Console* is where you type commands for `R` to run, and where `R` prints back the results of what you have told it to do.  


## Running code in the *Console*  {-}

Type your first command into the *Console*, then press `Enter`:

```{r,echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
1 + 1
```

When you press `Enter`, R processes the command you fed it, then returns its result (`2`) just below your command.

Note that spaces don't matter. Both of the following two commands are legible to `R` and return the same thing:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
4 + 4
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
4+4
```

However, it is better to make your code as easy to read as possible, which usually means using spaces.

#### Exercise 1 {-}

Type a command in the *Console* to determine the sum of 596 and 198.

```{r, eval = is_teacher, echo=is_teacher,collapse=TRUE}
596 + 198
```

### Re-running code in the *Console* {-}

If you want to re-run the code you just ran, or if you want to recall the code so that you can adjust it slightly, click anywhere in the *Console* then press your keyboard's `Up` arrow.

If you keep pressing your `Up` arrow, `R` will present you with sequentially older commands.

If you accidentally recalled an old command without meaning to, you can reset the *Console*'s command line by pressing `Escape`.

#### Exercise 2 {-}

A. Re-run the sum of 596 and 198 without re-typing it.  

B. Recall the command again, but this time adjust the code to find the sum of 596 and 298.  

C. Practice escaping an accidentally called command: recall your most recent command, then clear the *Console*'s command line.

### Incomplete commands in `R` {-}

`R` gets confused when you enter an incomplete command, and will wait for you to write the remainder of your command on the next line in the *Console* before doing anything.

For example, try running this code in your *Console*:

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
45 +
```

You will find that `R` gives you a little `+` sign on the line under your command, which means it is waiting for you to complete your command.  

If you want to complete your command, add a number (e.g., `3)` and hit `Enter`. You should now be given an answer (e.g., `48`).  

If instead you want `R` to stop waiting and stop running, hit the `Escape` key.


### Getting errors in `R` {-}

`R` only understands your commands if they follow the rules of the `R` language (often referred to as its *syntax*). If `R` does not understand your code, it will throw an error and give up on trying to execute that line of code. 

For example, try running this code in your *Console*:

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,collapse=TRUE}
4 + 6p
```

You probably received a message in red font stating `Error: unexpected symbol in "4 + 6p"`. That is because R did know how to interpret the symbol `p` in this case. 

Get used to errors! They happen all the time, even (especially?) to professionals, and it is essential that you get used to reading your own code to find and fix its errors.


#### Exercise 3 {-}

Type a command in R that throws an error, then recall the command and revise so that `R` can understand it.


## Use R like a calculator {-}

As you can tell from those commands you just ran, `R` is, at heart, a fancy calculator.

Some calculations are straightforward, like addition and subtraction:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
490 + 1000
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
490 - 1000
```

Division is pretty straightfoward too:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
24 / 2
```

For multiplication, use an asterisk (`*`):

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
24 * 2
```

`R` is usually great about following classic rules for Order of Operations, and you can use parentheses to exert control over that order. For example, these two commands produce different results:  

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
2*7 - 2*5 / 2
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
(2*7 - 2*5) / 2
```

You denote exponents like this: 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
2 ^2
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
2 ^3
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
2 ^4
```

Finally, note that `R` is fine with negative numbers:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
9 + -100
```

#### Exercise 4 {-}

A. Find the sum of the ages of everyone in your immediate family.

B. Now recall that command and adjust it to determine the *average* age of the members of your family.


## Using operators in R {-}

You can get `R` to evaluate logical tests using *operators*.  

For example, you can ask whether two values are equal to each other.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
96 == 95
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
95 + 2 == 95 + 2
```

`R` is telling you that the first statement is `FALSE` (`96` is not, in fact, equal to `95`) and that the second statement is `TRUE` (`95 + 2` is, in fact, equal to itself).

Note the use of *double* equal signs here. You must use two of them in order for `R` to understand that you are asking for this logical test. 

You can also ask if two values are *NOT* equal to each other:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
96 != 95
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
95 + 2 != 95 + 2
```

This test is a bit more difficult to understand: In the first statement, `R` is telling you that it is `TRUE` that `96` is different from `95`. In the second statement, `R` is saying that it is `FALSE` that `95 + 2` is not the same as itself.

Note that `R` lets you write these tests another, even more confusing way:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
! 96 == 95
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
! 95 + 2 == 95 + 2
```

The first line of code is asking `R` whether it is not true that `96` and `95` are equal to each other, which is `TRUE`. The second line of code is asking `R` whether it is not true that `95 + 2` is the same as itself, which is of course `FALSE`.

Other commonly used operators in `R` include greater than / less than (`>` and `<`), and greater/less than or equal to (`>=` and `<=`).

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
100 > 100
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
100 >= 100
```


#### Exercise 5 {-}

A. Write and run a line of code that asks whether these two calculations return the same result:

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
2*7 - 2*5 / 2
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
(2*7 - 2*5) / 2
```

B. Now write and run a line of code that asks whether the first calculation is larger than the second:


## Use built-in functions within R {-}

`R` has some built-in "functions" for common calculations, such as finding square roots and logarithms. Functions are packages of code that take a given value, transform it according to some internal code instructions, and provide an output. You will learn more about functions in a few modules. 

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
sqrt(16)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
log(4)
```

Note that the function `log()` is the *natural log* function (i.e., the value that *e* must be raised to in order to equal 4). To calculate a base-10 logarithm, use `log10( )`.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
log(10)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
log10(10)
```

Another handy function is `round()`, for rounding numbers to a specific number of decimal places.

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
100/3
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
round(100/3)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
round(100/3,digits=1)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
round(100/3,digits=2)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
round(100/3,digits=3)
```

Finally, `R` also comes with some built-in values, such as *pi*:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE}
pi
```


#### Exercise 6 {-}

Find the square root of *pi* and round the answer to the 2 decimal places.


#### Review assignment: {-}

Show that the following statements are TRUE:

A. `pi` is greater than the square root of 9  

B. It is FALSE that the square root of 9 is greater than `pi`  

C. `pi` rounded to the nearest whole number equals the square root of 9
