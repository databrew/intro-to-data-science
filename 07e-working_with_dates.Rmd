## First steps  {-}

Hadley Wickham's [tutorial on dates](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) starts with 3 simple questions:


-   Does every year have 365 days?
-   Does every day have 24 hours?
-   Does every minute have 60 seconds?

"I'm sure you know that not every year has 365 days, but do you know the full rule for determining if a year is a leap year?
(It has three parts.) You might have remembered that many parts of the world use daylight savings time (DST), so that some days have 23 hours, and others have 25.
You might not have known that some minutes have 61 seconds because every now and then leap seconds are added because the Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down.

Dates and times are hard because they have to reconcile two physical phenomena (the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the sun) with a whole raft of geopolitical phenomena including months, time zones, and DST.
This chapter won't teach you every last detail about dates and times, but it will give you a solid grounding of practical skills that will help you with common data analysis challenges."

## Lubridate  {-}

Let's install the `lubridate` package.

## Getting familiar with the `date` type  {-}

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(lubridate)
today <- today()
my_birthday <- '1985-11-07'
str(today)
str(my_birthday)

# This causes an errors
# today - my_birthday

# This does not
my_birthday <- as_date(my_birthday)
today - my_birthday
```

## Converting dates from strings  {-}

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ymd("2017-01-31")
mdy("January 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")
```

What does the `tzone` argument to `today()` do? Why is it important?

Use the appropriate lubridate function to parse each of the following dates:

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
```

## Getting familiar with the `datetime` type  {-}

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
n <- now() 
n + seconds(1)
n - hours(5)
hour(n)
minute(n)
as_date(n)
later <- now()
```


## Extracting components from date and datetime objects  {-}


```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56")
year(datetime)
month(datetime)
mday(datetime)
yday(datetime)
wday(datetime)
weekdays(datetime)
```


## Cough data exercise  {-}


```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
coughs <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrew/intro-to-data-science/main/data/coughs.csv')
```

## Moon data exercise {-}

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
moon <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrew/intro-to-data-science/main/data/full_moon.csv')
```

## Weather data exercise {-}

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(weatherr)
library(tidygeocoder)
sewanee_location <- geo(address = '735 University Avenue, Sewanee TN')
fc <- locationforecast(lon = sewanee_location$long,
                       lat = sewanee_location$lat)

```

1. Plot the forecasted temperature

```{r,echo=TRUE,collapse=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = fc,
       aes(x = time,
           y = temperature)) +
  geom_point()
```

2. Get average cloudiness by day.

3. Plot average cloudiness by day.

4. Plot humidity.

5. Get the maximum temperature by hour (without date). Plot it.

6. Make a variable called `date`. This should just be the date (without the time)

7. Plot wind direction over time, with the line color showing the date.
