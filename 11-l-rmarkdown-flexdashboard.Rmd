# Rmarkdown dashboards with flexdashboard


&nbsp;  

**1.** Install Rmarkdown.

**2.** Start a new Rmarkdown file. In RStudio, pick the "From Template" option. Pick flexdashboard. Name your file "dashboard.Rmd".

**3.** Set up your work space by loading the `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `flexdashboard`, `leaflet.extras`, `leaflet`, and `lubridate` packages.

**3.** Read in some violence data by running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if(!file.exists('violence.RData')){
  download.file('https://github.com/databrew/intro-to-data-science/blob/main/data/GEDEvent_v21_1.RData?raw=true', 'violence.RData')
}
load('violence.RData')
vio <- GEDEvent_v21_1; rm(GEDEvent_v21_1)
```

**4.** Take a look at some details on the data here: https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ged/ged211.pdf

**5.** Take a look at the head of your data. What is the unit of observation?

**6.** Make a dashboard showing some interesting aspect of violence. It should include at least 3 panels, of which at least 1 should be a map. Be creative.
