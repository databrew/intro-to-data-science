# What is Git?

Git is a software for "version control": ie, tracking changes to sets of files. It is a very commonly used software in programming, computer science, data science, and software development in general. For anyone working in data science, knowing git is a must.

But _what is it_, exactly? Git is a system for tracking, organizing, sharing, and reviewing changes to software. It's very flexible, and very powerful. And learning it can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming, because it has so many features and capabilities. But the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) (ie, the 80/20 rule) applies here: most of what you need to know to competently handle git, you can do in very little time.
